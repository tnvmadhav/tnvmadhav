I've finally added my ü¶ã bluesky profile to my 'link in bio' page (bagel.ink/@tnvmadhav)


I took this beautiful iPhone Mockup of my link in the bio page using the WebShotPro iPhone application.

Get it here -> bagel.ink/c/DhLwv0


WebShotPro also generates an editable open graph image of the website based on the HTML metatags -- [üèûÔ∏è Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_0X0mval.png) [üèûÔ∏è Context #2](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_s0XKcuo.png) [üèûÔ∏è Context #3](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/_com.apple.Foundation.NSItemProvider.0asmzr.png) -- 2024-11-23T12:54:48.910Z

Today I learned about the term "Hyrum's Law" in software engineering.

It refers that even though implementation specifics are hidden, breadcrumbs of implementation will be expected to be consistent when there's no apparent change the interface signature.

And any implementation change can and will break a small subset of users' workflow. 

And yes there's an XKCD for it.


Quoting one of Go's package author:

"I wrote the crypto/rsa comments. We take Hyrum's Law (and backwards compatibility [1]) extremely seriously in Go. Here are a couple more examples" - [via HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42202326)

"Art" as we know it "could" become replicable (non-lossy).

And this is totally subjective, but in a world where every art is replicable, the question as what is the "new art" becomes bigger.

I believe for better or worse, "we" could be grandfathered in.

"Mistakes are a portal to creativity" -- Cillian Murphy on working with Christopher Nolan and experiences in his film set. He implies that most of brilliant moments on the cinema screen are a result of capturing those lightning in the bottle moments.

- [via X](https://twitter.com/twitter/status/1858276331223429260/)

I was fortunate to come across a documentation of one such example in [a tweet](https://x.com/NolanAnalyst/status/1857381028614066570) from a Nolan specific Fan account.

John Carmack writes about his (visibly) weird a game engine debugging dream and he suspects that the game engine must‚Äôve been written in C++ and the bug could‚Äôve been a uninitialised variable without doing an RCA.

A level domain knowledge in anything that leaves you guessing causes of uncommon scenarios in most cases is desirable.
