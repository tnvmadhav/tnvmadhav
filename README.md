> What beautiful irony: The prize for catching the carrot is the realization that chasing it was more fun -- DHH on the recent post by the CEO of Loom

This reminds me of the quote from Ging Freecss from [Hunter X Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_×_Hunter)

> "You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest. Because that's where you'll find things more important than what you want" -- Ging Freecss -- [🏞️ Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_AYHqVPg.png) -- 2025-01-07T03:09:41.790Z

Excerpts from [Reflections (2025), a post by Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/reflections)

> "We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents “join the workforce” and materially change the output of companies. We continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes."

> " Superintelligent tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own, and in turn massively increase abundance and prosperity."

Two years after incredible growth, OpenAI is moving the goalpost to A.S.I. beyond the relatively myopic A.G.I. goalpost[^1].

What sort of scaling laws apply here?

If A.S.I. is the goal, then is it okay for a "product" company to be the one to lead it's efforts? No clear answers but the mind is curious.

[^1] I'm curious to see what sort of approach one(by that I mean an entire  organization of industry-leading teams of researchers) would take to move to A.S.I.  -- 2025-01-06T01:54:06.149Z

Pacific Rim (2013) is such a good movie.  -- 2025-01-05T13:25:28.373Z

An A.I. agent that is trained on your taste.
You tell it what you want (regularly or just ad-hoc), and give it constraints if you're in a hurry.
It scours the web, finds links, measures as per your taste, and gives you a compilation.
You should be able to let it know what taste you'd like to develop.
Inherit this agent and deploy it to learning, shopping, exploring, etc.

In short, it is all aspects of life that you want to grow in.  -- 2025-01-05T04:04:00.072Z

I really don't know why but this snippet reminds me of the phrase

"[...]an unstoppable force meets an immovable object"

Not because I think there is a 1:1 mapping to this phrase but reminiscence.

[BitBasher](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42561176)

> "I built and run a saas product solo (> $500k/year). Honestly, I have never found any advice useful[...]

>[...]My business is b2b and it's a platform for certain kinds of professionals as well as an API that powers many well known businesses.

1. Networking
2. Long Game w/ SEO, Word of Mouth

> "I'd say focus on the long game from day one (blog posts, good marketing pages, etc)."

> "If no one wants to talk to you about it, no one is going to want to pay for it."

I found myself reading the (well-written) [Rules of Software Tutorials](https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/rules-for-software-tutorials/)[^1].

I'd started [publishing guides](https://tnvmadhav.me/guides/) for beginners[^2] and I found some value in the aforementioned post, that I will be inculcating in my future guides.

I'd highly recommend a read if you're a developer planning to write guides or technical documentation.


[^1]: which I found on visiting [the front page of hacker news.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42574641 )

[^2]: Or just... me in a couple of years where I might be needing a refresher.
