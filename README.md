I "vibe coded" a @github action to archive my daily live feed as markdown blog posts.

This was initially done using a manually scaffolded LaunchDaemon plist on my macbook but the issue was if the device was offline (without internet connection) at the time of archiving, it would sometimes not run at all.

Debugging why plist cron jobs couldn't run was something I didn't want to do so I now delegated it to github actions instead.  -- 2025-05-03T11:43:25.324Z

Quoting comment on the License change of Redis  from SSPL to AGPL

> ‚ÄúI have a great deal of respect for antirez and rec[o]gnize him as a kind and benevolent member of the FOSS community, but no matter what Redis, Inc. announced or does, they have lost my trust for good, and I will continue to use Redis forks for as long as they exist.‚Äù

[via HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43859854)

loss of trust is a one way door . Once you cross it, in most situations it‚Äôs hard to get back and needs incredible effort and sacrifice to gain back lost trust.

Integrity on the fly is important. I know that things won‚Äôt be smooth sailing always and the absurdist in us agrees that we may have to take decisions that we ideally won‚Äôt.

that is exactly why decision makers need to have skin in the game on the long run.  -- 2025-05-02T04:49:52.220Z

I really hope vibe coding stops after going from zero to one.

The term vibe engineering sends shivers down my spine but one man's fear is another man's opportunity.

When push comes to shove, we must be able to turn a vibe coded product to a well engineered sound product and business.

overthinking is anticipating the nth order effect of an action or lack thereof.

overthinking often collapses to a delusion. then, emotional turmoil. 

instead, how about we try to stack actions that seem to yield only positive growth regardless of feedbacks leading to different nth order effects?

then, we're just indirectly limiting decisions to 1st order effects only make things easier on the mind. This curtails  overthinking & its negative effects by several orders.

Not speaking for positive effects of overthinking cuz it's not productive üòÖ for me.  -- 2025-04-25T08:29:05.399Z

For the long term, it's important to know what is actually going on because a project is subject to modifications and extensions.

Speaking of extensions and modifications, vibe coding on the other hand calls for complete rewrite and, though A.I could eventually do a complete rewrite to support further updates. It feels we're disrespecting the G.P.U.s and resources to get things done in a suboptimal way (if you will).

The struggle to not let time (and by generalization, entropy) affect the quality of our actions only gets bigger until it‚Äôs fully internalized by the mind and body.  -- 2025-04-23T07:36:58.589Z
