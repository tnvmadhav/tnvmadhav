A small % of iPhone 14 plus phones have a camera hardware issue.

Apple says it or an Authorized Service Provider could service your phone for free.

Some conditions apply but you can check with your iPhone‚Äôs serial number on [Apple‚Äôs support page](https://support.apple.com/iphone-14-plus-service-program-for-rear-camera-issue)

[via The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285851/some-iphone-14-plus-phones-have-a-camera-issue-but-apple-may-fix-it-for-free)


I‚Äôve had a similar issue but with the iPhone 13 series where the display hardware was faulty and Apple Authorized Service Provider verified and fixed it for free.

I‚Äôd written and shared a post about it and you can read about [my experience on my blog](https://tnvmadhav.me/blog/white-screen-of-death-on-my-iphone/ ). -- 2024-11-02T08:30:05.489Z

A successful founder gets things done.

A person who has an intense *want* will find ways to get things done.  

This intensity comes from life experiences.

Bad childhood can build character and lead to strong *wants*.

See where the road converges?

I spent some time to make some significant performance improvements (low hanging) to my blog. 

The lighthouse score on the mobile looks pretty good now.

I'd also run [a scan](https://radar.cloudflare.com/scan/956526a3-8907-43a8-b445-051873a77989/summary) on @cloudflare's radar tool and found that total bytes score was less than 512kB.

This means that my little site has (unofficially) entered the [512kb.club](https://512kb.club) ü•≥

I [opened a pull request](https://github.com/kevquirk/512kb.club/pull/1661) to make it official. Fingers crossed ü§ûüèª -- [üèûÔ∏è Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_tiE1nZK.png) -- 2024-11-01T15:46:09.891Z

I'm experimenting with chatgpt's ability to count calories of the food and suggest wait time before having the next meal.

1. Click picture of food
2. Send to chatGPT
3. Receive rough time gap in hours
3. Set a timer to wait before having next meal -- [üèûÔ∏è Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/calorie-genie-demo.gif) -- 2024-11-01T12:29:27.349Z

what? nothing. just me thinking about "the boy and the heron" / "how to live" an entire week after watching it. i thought i knew hayao miyazaki but he surprised me with this incredible feat. again. -- [üèûÔ∏è Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_1dttvnP.png) -- 2024-11-01T04:41:08.425Z

TIL we can prevent bash script from prematurely exiting using `set +e`.

```bash
set +e
<some command>
set -e
```

This knowledge is useful if you want to run certain scripts and perform custom actions on the resultant exit code without losing information due to premature exits.

[1] [Open Source AI Definition as per Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/blog/the-open-source-initiative-announces-the-release-of-the-industrys-first-open-source-ai-definition)

> The OSAID offers a standard by which community-led, open and public evaluations will be conducted to validate whether or not an AI system can be deemed Open Source AI.

> "The new definition requires Open Source models to provide enough information about their training data so that a ‚Äòskilled person can recreate a substantially equivalent system using the same or similar data,‚Äô which goes further than what many proprietary or ostensibly Open Source models do today,‚Äù said Ayah Bdeir, who leads AI strategy at Mozilla"

[2] [Open Source AI Definition 1.0](https://opensource.org/ai/open-source-ai-definition)

1. Free to use without permission
2. Study the components to learn how it works
3. Modify for use to change the output
4. Share with other with or without modification

> These freedoms apply both to a fully functional system and to discrete elements of a system. A precondition to exercising these freedoms is to have access to the preferred form to make modifications to the system.

This involves data, code and weights. -- 2024-10-29T06:30:05.879Z

This is a dumbed down (simple) take.

A.I. is to ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù as what client side javascript is to HTML.

Elimination of extra time and effort to gain a certain outcome.

I was able to convert, and load some of my computer science related notes in .txt files like HTTP and Redis onto Anki in seconds.

I was able to revise in matter of minutes!

Thank you @openai :)


One can find [this script useful](https://gist.github.com/tnvmadhav/8bc0070b65b263034815127f9974677e) if you wanna automate Anki flashcard generation with Python and ChatGPT.

TIL about the cookiecutter PyPi package

It's a quick way to scaffold new python packages, plugins, django projects and [many more](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html#special-templates ) from pre-built templates.

Using jinja2 template syntax, one can create an entire cookiecutter project template for use and reuse.

A comprehensive documentation can be found [on the internet](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html#cookiecutter ). -- 2024-10-26T13:30:03.046Z
