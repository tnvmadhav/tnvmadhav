Following the pictorial trend on the idea of Roko's Basilisk, I asked chatGPT to generate an image on how I’d treated it.

You perform the best with a controlled amount of healthy stress.

Too much or too little stress can have negative consequences. 

Practice and know your levels and limits.  -- 2026-01-18T06:30:02.716Z

On Claude getting too myopic when working with large codebases

“A skillful driver can mitigate this, but most lack the skill”

“Just two missing characters in a Regex filter allowed unauthenticated attackers to infiltrate the build environment and leak privileged credentials”

This is a well written disclosure document 👍

I just installed opencode using the “oh-my-opencode” wrapper and asked it to add a feature which I wanted to build in my side project, and guess what… in just 2 big shots, it was able to make a working version of it with minor tweaks from my side.

The value add is insane!  -- 2026-01-10T09:36:15.738Z

> It genuinely feels to me like GPT-5.2 and Opus 4.5 in November represent an inflection point - one of those moments where the models get incrementally better in a way that tips across an invisible capability line where suddenly a whole bunch of much harder coding problems open up
> It's possible Gemini 3 Pro should be included in that group as well, but I'm not seeing quite the same level of astonished buzz from hardened software engineers around that model as I am for the other two .

I am currently unable to add images to GitHub issues :(

Is this an outage?
https://www.githubstatus.com says otherwise


Posted about it on X

Ah, got it. The image file was too big (>10MB)

I tried to add the file in a pull request and the error response told me this.

All good. Perhaps the issue was that the error response in @GitHub actions is different from pull requests. -- [🏞️ Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_BAN87tk.png) -- 2025-12-31T06:29:15.226Z

We are at a point where we don’t usually care whether content is pure / semi ai slop anymore because the prompters are so good at emulating content that we deem as real and this means, another cambrian explosion of content is imminent.

This is just 3 years since the first milestone.  -- 2025-12-20T04:11:19.736Z
