I came across the term "impedance mismatch" when revisiting the concept of demultiplexing. 

It turns out that the term is used in multiple contexts like in database management, demultiplexing (and now in just about anything that involves comparison of expectation vs reality).

A nice post[^1] on dealing with large codebases in general:

> Summary
> - Large codebases are worth working in because they usually pay your salary
> - By far the most important thing is consistency
> - Never start a feature without first researching prior art in the codebase
> - If you don‚Äôt follow existing patterns, you better have a very good reason for it
> - Understand the production footprint of the codebase
> - Don‚Äôt expect to be able to test every case - instead, rely on monitoring
> - Remove code any chance you get, but be very careful about it
> - Make it as easy as possible for domain experts to catch your mistakes

> What beautiful irony: The prize for catching the carrot is the realization that chasing it was more fun -- DHH on the recent post by the CEO of Loom

This reminds me of the quote from Ging Freecss from [Hunter X Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_√ó_Hunter)

Excerpts from [Reflections (2025), a post by Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/reflections)

> "We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents ‚Äújoin the workforce‚Äù and materially change the output of companies. We continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes."

> " Superintelligent tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own, and in turn massively increase abundance and prosperity."

Two years after incredible growth, OpenAI is moving the goalpost to A.S.I. beyond the relatively myopic A.G.I. goalpost[^1].

What sort of scaling laws apply here?

If A.S.I. is the goal, then is it okay for a "product" company to be the one to lead it's efforts? No clear answers but the mind is curious.

[^1] I'm curious to see what sort of approach one(by that I mean an entire  organization of industry-leading teams of researchers) would take to move to A.S.I.  -- 2025-01-06T01:54:06.149Z

An A.I. agent that is trained on your taste.
You tell it what you want (regularly or just ad-hoc), and give it constraints if you're in a hurry.
It scours the web, finds links, measures as per your taste, and gives you a compilation.
You should be able to let it know what taste you'd like to develop.
Inherit this agent and deploy it to learning, shopping, exploring, etc.

In short, it is all aspects of life that you want to grow in.  -- 2025-01-05T04:04:00.072Z

I really don't know why but this snippet reminds me of the phrase

"[...]an unstoppable force meets an immovable object"

Not because I think there is a 1:1 mapping to this phrase but reminiscence.
