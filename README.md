Becoming a generator, not a renderer.

TIL that there's a whole package (I mean it was obvious in-retrospect) called `Charts` in SwiftUI. [^1] 

I was experimenting with bar graphs and charts (for an iOS app - hobby project) and was planning on raw dogging rectangles (ik LMFAO).

But now the Charts package can help cut down on time. I'm yet to dive deep but it looks super easy (thanks to SwiftUI's simplicity) but I'm sure I can get results faster.

After playing with Bar Graphs and referring to example implementations [^2], I noticed that one could create the same types of charts baked in iOS apps like screentime, health, etc support.

This is great news (in general but) especially for backend developers like myself who are dabbling with design and client-side application development for (limited scope) hobby projects.

If this happens to anyone on @X, you should immediately log in to x.com and go to [Sessions page](https://x.com/settings/apps_and_sessions) and check if this is true. 

If you're still unsure, click `log out all other sessions` button only via the official x.com app/website's sessions page.

Keep safe!

Just migrated to GPT 4 [structured outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) (out of sheer frustration) in my hobby project. It's so much better now. 

More deterministic I should say in terms of NOT getting an `unexpected end of JSON input` error message intermittently.

Thank you @openai for this productivity boost :) -- 2024-08-23T04:20:23.517Z

I don't understand why people hold absolutist ideals (for others) on building stuff.

Like do what you want and eventually stick to something that works for you and your team.

This is an [interesting infographic](https://a16z.com/100-gen-ai-apps/) from a16z depicting the top 50 Gen A.I. products by unique monthly visitors.

I'd like to think I do keep myself up to date on the latest GenAI products and releases on X.

But, (to my surprise) I found that `character.ai` is placed at Number 2 üò≥ above Perplexity and Claude.

Strangely not many (in my X feed) talk about it that much. I didn't even know what they did exactly.

It's about chatting with AI avatars of characters mainly from pop culture.

I see >100 million conversations with fictional anime characters like Tatsuki Bakugo (from BHA anime/story) and characters from the popular game called Genshin Impact.

And it makes so much sense (to me). This is something people don't usually talk about because it could be private.

Once again I'm reminded that I'm only in the tech development bubble and do not have a grasp of the full scale of the proliferation of A.I. in all segments of the internet.

And this is just one segment. I have only used 3-4 of these. Worth a deeper dive on. -- 2024-08-22T14:30:28.199Z

While scrolling on X, I came across an intriguing and deep question from a profile I follow:

[**‚ÄúWould you quit your job for $1M?‚Äù**](https://x.com/LiveDigitalArt/status/1826213407306944547)

A million dollars is life-changing money for 99% of the current human population. 

So, unless someone lives well beyond their means, they could realistically quit their job, even in certain places within first-world nations.

But what would a person do afterward?

Surely, everyone desires the freedom to pursue their own interests. 

Perhaps a person could completely change their life, start over, if you will. 

So what comes next? 

Now that you‚Äôre no longer forced to work on things out of necessity, you can do whatever you please.

This scenario is somewhat akin to a life where Universal Basic Income (UBI) is normalized and enforced.

So, what makes this question intriguing?

It‚Äôs about what comes after you break free of an obligation. 

You can understand a person by what they choose to do in their free time. 

I think this question can be extended or rephrased as:  **‚ÄúWhat projects would you work on if money weren‚Äôt a problem?‚Äù**

Everyone wants to pursue their life‚Äôs work.

‚û°Ô∏è *Almost everyone‚Äôs answer to the original question would be ‚Äúyes‚Äù but, answers for latter would truly be fun to read and think about.* -- 2024-08-22T06:30:03.072Z
