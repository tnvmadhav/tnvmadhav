Shipping with assertion turned on, should ideally be done from the projects' inception and not when project is already being used by customers.

The point I'm trying to make is that if you and you're team are still working on fast iteration cycles and aren't there yet, you can slowly adapt to using asserts in production code, and not all at once.


Turning asserts on in production codebase is definitely a way to help team build fast iteration cycles in terms of Nth order effects.

Typing manually is layer 1 and boilerplate generation is the prime subject to building additional layers.

Code generation tools are just a convenience layer to help when we’re constrained on resources like time, brain power etc.

Code generation can be used to automate testing boilerplate and test case transcription. 

The test cases themselves could ideally be handwritten or designed to keep the context in the operators’ flow states.

# TIL How to open any file in browser from the terminal

I always knew we could open any file in the browser on my Mac but I didn't know how.
Today I did and it's super simple.

> open -a Safari notes.txt

It's the same for any file. Here's an example of a markdown file:

> open -a Safari notes.md


## Side note
This knowledge opens a way to better deal with situations in real life. Like,
if we have a markdown previewer extension on the browser of our choice, then
it's super useful during demos and presentations where we can keep the text  editor and 
preview windows decoupled from each other.

Ideally, we don't want to have two applications but have a single app showing
editing and previewing mode.

## Visual Studio Code is a great alternative
The existing solution is to use Visual Studio Code. with the inbuilt preview markdown  feature. 
Command + Shift + V to preview the existing markdown file. It's great for most use-cases. 

If you need a simpler setup, one can use Neovim plugins. They are generally faster than electron app based
solutions (not that it matters a lot but the inner purists in use can  disagree).   -- 2025-10-09T07:54:47.495Z

I fell into a rabbit hole on Twitter.

I was scrolling and I found a footage of how the maker of prince of persia rotoscoped VHS recording of his younger brother into the game
mechanics.[^1]

I then found a link to a behind the Scenes sort of thing in retrospect[^2]

> "Your initial vision is just the first draft. You discover things along the way"

The designer Jordan kept a journal ( a log if you will) on every piece of inspiration or idea that he got from either media (or) just general feedback that his colleagues and friends gave while he was showing it to them.

> "Whenever you are faced with two choices, through two voices, ask youself, which one speaks towards the overall picture" ~ paraphrased version

### Excerpts from Signal’s post in response to E.U.’s Chat Control Policy Proposal[^1]

> We are alarmed by reports that Germany is on the verge of a catastrophic about-face, reversing its longstanding and principled
opposition to the EU’s Chat Control proposal.

> Under the guise of protecting children, the latest Chat Control proposals would require mass scanning of every message, photo,
and video on a person’s device, assessing these via a government-mandated database or AI model to determine whether they are permissible content or not.

> These proposals ignore the strategic importance of private communications, and the longstanding technical consensus that you cannot create a backdoor that only lets the “good guys” in. 

Signal shares a research paper on the dangers of client side scanning[^2]

> we were given a choice between building a surveillance machine into Signal or leaving the
market, we would leave the market.

> We urge Germany to be wise and to stand firm in its principles. We cannot let history repeat itself, this
time with bigger databases and much much more sensitive data.
