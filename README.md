advice to young kids by john carmack:

>"knowledge and depth"
>"through and through"
>"find inefficiencies that can be bypassed"
>"its not necessary, be reliable, do quality work"
>"but people who do have inclination to doing things deeper, there are layers of things out there, it's amazing"
>"it's better than ever"
>"whole new worlds to explore"
>"hard work, understand as much as you can"
>"you will make more total progress, by telling yourself that there is a whole broad world around me"
>"preparing myself with broad tools and im being aware of change"
>"looking for opportunies to deploy the tools you've built"
>"go deeper and bypass inefficiencies"
>"make things better"  -- 2025-07-20T14:32:30.407Z

Salvatore Sanfilippo uses Gemini 2.5 Pro / Claude to fix vector set bugs in redis core.

Here are some excerpts that I found interesting:

>The most famous LLMs are not the best. Coding activities should be performed mostly with:
>
>* Gemini 2.5 PRO
>* Claude Opus 4
>
>Gemini 2.5 PRO is, in my experience, semantically more powerful. Can spot more complex bugs, reason about more complex problems. Claude Opus may be better at writing new code sometimes (sometimes not), the user interface is more pleasant, and in general you need at least two LLMs to do some back and forth for complex problems in order to enlarge your (human) understanding of the design space. If you can pick just one, go for Gemini 2.5 PRO.

I have been using only chatGPT whenever I use an LLM to help me get some coding/knowledge work done. Looks like I gotta start using Gemini 2.5 pro now.

> Always be part of the loop by moving code by hand from your terminal to the LLM web interface: this guarantees that you follow every process.
> You are still the coder, but augmented.

I too prefer keeping my llm answers in my terminal or web browser itself.
I don't use A.I. in my IDE (vscode and sometimes neovim) because I like to keep control on what goes in my editor.

back in my day, vibe coding meant copy-pasting code from stackoverflow.

I fed an LLM a journal entry asking it specific questions about different problems I‚Äôve have been facing and after the long discussion, it told one thing that resonated with me:

‚Äúperfectionism is surgical and not blanket‚Äù  -- 2025-07-19T17:30:02.527Z

TIL: golang has a sort package that has sort string method.

and the strings will be sorted by alphabetical/lexicographical order.

[Playground Instance Link](https://go.dev/play/p/R5ev464yUkd)


...an alternative way (and a much better way) is using the slices package and calling `slices.Sort()` which is agnostic of the data type.  -- 2025-07-19T11:44:06.798Z

I found this tweet from naval:

> Technology will eventually have to
> drive human evolution (embryo
> selection, gene editing). 
> 
> Otherwise, our technology will 
> evolve faster than our biology and 
> lead to Paleolithic humans facing 
> Neolithic stressors. 

it does link to the idea of the great filter and this statement popped into my head immediately after:

the great filter is just stressors in different costumes  -- 2025-07-19T04:28:28.687Z
