I found myself revisiting rauchg's 7 principles of rich web applications:

1. Pre-rendering isn't optional
2. React immediately to user input
3. React to data changes (server side included)
4. Control data exchange between client and server
5. Don't break history, enhance it
6. Push code updates (yes client code updates)
7. Predict Behaviour (I honestly think this is overkill ‚Äî but brilliant if pulled off)

This (re-)read was part of my dive into "how vercel ships good quality software so quickly" assumption.


And oh, here's the link to the article from 2014, ‚Äî the examples are really helpful to wrap your mind around the concepts that are seemingly complex (at first).

While diving into @google's Willow Quantum AI chip rabbit hole, as a physical reaction to the exponential error correction nature, I couldn't help but correlated qubit lattices to this meme. -- [üèûÔ∏è Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_iWpeMfv.png) -- 2024-12-11T08:25:38.680Z

Someone tried to inject a crypto miner into the ultralytics PyPi package (v8.3.41 & v8.3.42)

While these versions no longer are downloadable, if it already is (cached or otherwise) because you're using it, Please delete those versions / update immediately.

The GitHub issue is still ongoing with what could've been done to avoid this.

Here's a comprehensive writeup by the yossarian (@8x5clPW2) on what happened.
