The browser wars have officially begun and whoever participates is forced to improve the agentic flows and there would be (IMO) a local maxima beyond which prompt injection becomes a catastrophic vector.

If google chooses to not participate, a significant portion of people can choose to migrate off google chrome and google might lose a significant chunk of market share or something idk‚Ä¶ only until things go belly up when really bad prompt injection events come to light 

If google chooses to participate, then it‚Äôs over. Google chrome has a large market share and this means google will also be cornered into the aforementioned local maxima until damage is already done to small % of affected users. small % but large absolute number.

Prompt injections cannot be stopped until something novels comes about. but for time being it‚Äôs not looking good for google (in near term atleast). happy to be wrong about it.

You must‚Äôve heard the ‚Äúwhy is my washing machine sending soo much data to cloud?‚Äù joke from a few years ago.

Well, now replace ‚Äòwashing machine‚Äô with ‚Äòbed‚Äô

[Quoting Michael Zimmermann](https://x.com/zimm3rmann/status/1980491408948572167?s=46)

> Is 16+gb/mo a normal amount of telemetry? Can you not do any local compute of ‚Äúget hot‚Äù or ‚Äúget cold‚Äù with a multi core processor and multiple gigabytes of memory? Can‚Äôt just repeat the previous nights settings? 
> 
> It‚Äôs bad enough that you slapped a $ 200/yr subscription on things, worse that it doesn‚Äôt work at all without internet.


This whole thing came to light after many instances of EightSleep mattresses (pods) stopped functioning due to an AWS outage (which is hilarious and horrific at the same time).

This reminds me of a joke (and a truth):

> If you want to know how dependent something is to the world, turn it off
 
A single high-value region on AWS went down recently and several external entities were disrupted and EightSleep pods were one of them.

EightSleep is fine but anything else that‚Äôs very critical is not. 

This global incident should be a wake up call for dependent services to plan and support failovers. For consumer products to support offline mode. (either ways for a temp controlled bed to depend on cloud to function normally is ridiculous to a layman).

feature, not a bug

All on-call engineers should be hooked up to @eightsleep pods whose functioning is dependent on current uptime of the services they are up-keeping :)  -- 2025-10-22T04:25:52.737Z

Today I learned that the generic function with multiple implementations based on the types of the a single arguments are called as single dispatch functions.

I'm dropping a reference to the mention on [__*the official python 3 documentation*__](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-single-dispatch)  -- 2025-10-20T04:40:13.342Z

Shipping with assertion turned on, should ideally be done from the projects' inception and not when project is already being used by customers.

The point I'm trying to make is that if you and you're team are still working on fast iteration cycles and aren't there yet, you can slowly adapt to using asserts in production code, and not all at once.


Turning asserts on in production codebase is definitely a way to help team build fast iteration cycles in terms of Nth order effects.

They learn (or) you go belly up. You choose. It's a do or die thing.  -- 2025-10-17T08:50:20.963Z
