Excerpts from ["Desperation Induced Focus"](https://www.rkg.blog/desperation-induced-focus.php )

> "Most big companies aren’t focused on creating things out of nothing. Someone else made the magic money-making machine, and they assume that it will just keep working."
>
> "This lack of focus is a luxury and a disease."

This is called peace time thinking. Thoughts generated out of seemingly derived notions or non-axioms. Sometimes too much trust in the system.

> My advice to people when they are thinking about instituting a new process is to go to a whiteboard and write down the answer to this question: “If you could only get one thing done this year, what would it be?”. 

>  Desperation inspires creativity and intense focus. It is an essential ingredient to building great products and services.

> So, the next time you feel desperate, lean in. Embrace it. Use it as the fuel to create the next founding moment4 for your company.

> And the next time someone tries to tell you to do something because a big company does it, be suspicious.

One must arrive at something from first principles and not because someone told them (a.k.a. by proxy). Keep the advice in mind and use it as a reminder but never an axiom.

I'd stumbled upon a rather brilliant @leetcode editorial piece and a useful mind map on solving problems. 

This something that a younger version of me would've appreciated especially when starting out.

I've shared some notes and excerpts on my [blog](https://tnvmadhav.me/feed/2024/10/21/ ) -- 2024-10-22T03:37:31.352Z

Notes from [leetcode's editorial section](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-a-string-into-the-max-number-of-unique-substrings/editorial/
) on solving data structures and algorithm problems in general.

After solving a leetcode problem, found myself checking out an editorial section to see what other approaches I could've missed. What I found was unexpected.

A guide to identifying patterns and choosing approaches. This is something I could've used when I was a couple of years younger just starting out.

> So this time before diving into the answer, let’s understand a few general patterns that you can use in your future journey:
>
> Sorted Input:
>
> Apply binary search for efficient element lookup.
> Use the two-pointer technique for problems involving pairs or segments.
> Unsorted Input:
>
> Apply dynamic programming for questions related to counting ways or optimizing values.
> Use backtracking for problems that ask for all possibilities or combinations (this is also a suitable fallback if dynamic programming isn’t going to work).
> Use a Trie for prefix matching and string-building scenarios.
> Use a hash map or set to find specific elements quickly.
> Implement a monotonic stack or sliding window technique for managing elements while continuously finding maximum or minimum values.
> Input is a Graph or Tree:

> Use DFS to explore all paths or when the question does not require finding the shortest path.
> Use BFS when the question asks for the shortest path or fewest steps.
> For binary trees, use DFS if the problem involves exploring specific depths or levels.
> Linked List Input:

> Use techniques involving slow and fast pointers or "prev" and "dummy" pointers to facilitate certain operations if you are unsure how to achieve a specific outcome.

> Note: There's so much more to this pattern! We just wanted to give you a glimpse of what pattern recognition boils down to in its simplest form. Feel free to add your own flair and create a detailed chart!

This takes the general concept of "put your money where your mouth is" and zooms out a bit IMO.

Reframe as "if your mouth isn't where your money is, where is it?"

Perhaps goals are just misaligned.

It's not about the immediate output but how it interacts with the world.

Zooming out every now and then, helps in keeping tunnel vision at bay. -- 2024-10-20T18:30:03.007Z

Notes from [Local First Software](https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/local-first.pdf):

With the introduction and proliferation of "cloud-hosted" Software as a Service (SaaS), especially for consumer software, it becomes unclear who owns the data that flows through them.

Many times, the users who upload/generate data don't have complete control over what happens to them.

Moreover, the experience of using application software has become unnecessarily complex and painful.

> If you’re a software engineer, designer, product manager, or independent app developer working on production-ready software today, how can you help? 

The paper proposes an alternative concept called "Local First", a guide for software developers to support experiences w.r.t. speed, ownership of data, and quality of use.

Seven points to use as guideways for the uninitiated:

> 1. Make it Fast

Feedback has to be instant and non-blocking. Network calls (to servers or stores for example) affect this the most.

> 2. Multi-Device

As the name suggests, "local first" doesn't mean data and software should always be offline; rather, the "sync" if necessary, needs to be quiet, in the background, and non-blocking.

> 3. Offline Support

Not all software / client-side applications, need to interact with remote servers for all tasks.

Offline support means having a copy of all relevant resources available to work on without internet access.

> 4. Collaborative

When a large enough ecosystem supports local first development, there needs to be a system to support collision detection and resolution systems. 

This is highly relevant for Google, GitHub, etc.

> 5. Longevity

This is purely data-centric. Data needs to persist independently of the software that creates/processes it.

This means data should be importable/exportable into standard formats.

> 6. Privacy

Data that is private must be able to remain private. Local First Development supports this philosophy.

> 7. User Control

The user must be able to choose where the data is stored. The user should be able to have 100% ownership of the data. The user can choose to do whatever they want with it. -- 2024-10-19T08:34:42.678Z

Great timing.

I looked forward to the customizability of NotebookLM's, audio podcast generation (Solid Product!).

I can now customize and provide instructions on what to focus on when given a particularly technical document.

Thank you @Google and team!
