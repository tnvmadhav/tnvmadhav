List of phrases from lives of high agency people:

you can just do things
you need to be more delusional
it‚Äôs time to build
don‚Äôt ask for permission
move fast and break things
the quick shall inherit the earth
live players
go direct
founder mode
man in the arena
don‚Äôt die [^1]
‚Äî-
does it defy the laws of physics?
there's no unsolvable problem
everything is a skill issue
adults don't exist
there's no way
all normal behaviour is forgotten. only weird behaviour survives.
one giant game of Roy
optimise for the best story
the amygdala is outdated hardware

Genuinely think the race to A.G.I. needs the rivalry of this ilk and yes it has begun.

Cal Newport on TikTok[^1]

> When I sign in for the first time, TikTok asks me to choose my interests from a long list illustrated by cheerful emojis. I select ‚ÄúLife Hacks,‚Äù ‚ÄúScience and Education,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSports.‚Äù Then I‚Äôm off. The first video shows the Clemson University baseball team playing an exhibition game against the Savannah Bananas, a professional touring squad. The Clemson infield, for some inscrutable reason, starts dancing. I swipe up. A new video begins, showing someone selecting shoes at a store. The video is only ten seconds long; by the time I‚Äôve finished jotting down some notes, it has already started replaying. I hastily swipe again. The next video plays tranquil music while a car slowly drives toward Yosemite National Park. The algorithm must have noticed that I lingered on the wintry scene: the next video shows someone sweeping snow off a porch with some kind of rotating broom contraption. Then the feed takes a darker turn, which makes me want to scroll even faster. I see a news story about a person being pushed onto subway tracks in Manhattan‚Äîswipe‚Äîa Trump video set to ominous music‚Äîswipe‚Äî‚ÄúTop 15 Most Ghetto High Schools in New Jersey‚Äù‚Äîswipe‚Äîand someone making fun of a server‚Äôs accent in a restaurant. I shut down the app.

But if he were to again, I really hope he doesn't come across "brain rot" ever but a part of me wants him to go down that rabbit hole (and write about how he felt).
