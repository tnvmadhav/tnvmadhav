I fell into a rabbit hole on Twitter.

I was scrolling and I found a footage of how the maker of prince of persia rotoscoped VHS recording of his younger brother into the game
mechanics.[^1]

I then found a link to a behind the Scenes sort of thing in retrospect[^2]

> "Your initial vision is just the first draft. You discover things along the way"

The designer Jordan kept a journal ( a log if you will) on every piece of inspiration or idea that he got from either media (or) just general feedback that his colleagues and friends gave while he was showing it to them.

> "Whenever you are faced with two choices, through two voices, ask youself, which one speaks towards the overall picture" ~ paraphrased version

### Excerpts from Signal’s post in response to E.U.’s Chat Control Policy Proposal[^1]

> We are alarmed by reports that Germany is on the verge of a catastrophic about-face, reversing its longstanding and principled
opposition to the EU’s Chat Control proposal.

> Under the guise of protecting children, the latest Chat Control proposals would require mass scanning of every message, photo,
and video on a person’s device, assessing these via a government-mandated database or AI model to determine whether they are permissible content or not.

> These proposals ignore the strategic importance of private communications, and the longstanding technical consensus that you cannot create a backdoor that only lets the “good guys” in. 

Signal shares a research paper on the dangers of client side scanning[^2]

> we were given a choice between building a surveillance machine into Signal or leaving the
market, we would leave the market.

> We urge Germany to be wise and to stand firm in its principles. We cannot let history repeat itself, this
time with bigger databases and much much more sensitive data.

Veritasium posted another all timer on their channel called  "Something Strange Happens When You Trace How Connected We Are"[^1]

This piece helps answer some questions I've been pondering about for a while now. Really well made video. 

👏 Kudos to Derek and the entire team! 

Now, I need to go deeper into Network Sociology and Emergent Behaviours to get my answers.

Getting fit isn’t rocket science but the execution requires rocket science level of determination and mindset:

>1. 500-800 calories deficit
>2. Minimum 150g protein
>3. Lift full body 3x / week
>4. 10K step a day, non-negotiable
>
> That's what we do inside our crew.
