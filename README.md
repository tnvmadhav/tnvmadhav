The cost of doing code reviews is the obligatory burden of the whole context loaded in your brain before you start reviewing.

While skimming through Simon's list of posts[^1], I realised that I've found the term that I'd been looking for --  "Semantic Diffusion" (where the original idea/meaning dampens with time/loose adoption)

> Semantic diffusion occurs when you have a word that is coined by a person or group, often with a pretty good definition, but then gets spread through the wider community in a way that weakens that definition. This weakening risks losing the definition entirely - and with it any usefulness to the term.

I've always had an appreciation to teams that ship products and features at an incredible pace. I've always thought it's possible to do it without making mistakes. Still do.  -- 2025-03-23T04:14:47.888Z
