I came across a post that sheds light on the origin of VIM:

an A.I. fine-tuned to make your pool of engineers efficient and faster every day.  -- 2025-04-18T12:10:16.812Z

scrolling social media is like incentivising perpetual ephemeral thoughts and ideas.

ideally one should gain something out of it but we ignore going deeper into certain interesting thoughts and instead, keep surfing 🏄 

that is not why we should use social media.

posters are getting something done and posting about it but consumers are just window-shopping (weird way to put it)  -- 2025-04-18T04:28:15.490Z

I'm strangely attracted to the idea of commit driven development.

Break down the task into list of commits annotated by the commit messages in great detail.

Tackle each of them in sequence.

It helps me keep stick to commit message while doing the changes.


It's like a todo list but specific to low level implementation details.  -- 2025-04-17T07:15:58.092Z

maybe my job at the end of the day is to decrease entropy.  -- 2025-04-14T11:58:36.192Z

Make moves to bring about positive change instead of proving / disproving existing data points about results of the moves pool (not a pool as it's unbounded)  -- 2025-04-09T03:36:32.146Z

I came across a post by @DHH about hiring developers[^1]. 
I opened it and this piece hit hard:

> Maybe it sounds a little harsh, but a programmer who's been working professionally for five years has likely already revealed their potential. What you're going to get is roughly what you see. That doesn't mean that people can't get better after that, but it means that the trajectory by which they improve has already been plotted.
