Writing Toy Software Is A Joy https://www.jsbarretto.com/blog/software-is-joy/


Some sentences that caught my attention:

> ‚ÄúWhat I cannot create, I do not understand‚Äù
> "[...]the joy in building toy projects like this comes from an exploration of the unknown, without polluting one‚Äôs mind with an existing solution.[...]"


> "I‚Äôve been consistently surprised by just how often some arcane nugget of knowledge I‚Äôve acquired when working on a toy project has turned out to be immensely valuable in my day job, either by giving me a head-start on tracking down a problem in a tool or library, or by recognising mistakes before they‚Äôre made."


> "If you‚Äôve been using LLMs for a while, this cold-turkey approach might even be painful at first, but persist. There is no joy without pain."
> "The runner‚Äôs high doesn‚Äôt come to those that take the bus."  -- 2025-06-18T03:01:30.620Z

I stumbled upon a post from 2010 with a very interesting title.
https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ufBYjpi9gK6uvtkh5/for-progress-to-be-by-accumulation-and-not-by-random-walk


I agree with the fact that top down learning(intentional progress) is much more efficient than bottom up learning (random walks). 

I believe this was something I supported for a long time now.  -- 2025-06-08T07:11:47.543Z

Tim Sweeney says that we gotta do a lot of different types of work to gain maturity and like don't focus on only one type. 


do a lot of things do a lot of coding a lot of practicing a lot of different styles and only then you will know the true sense of coding and then you can choose to go deep once you've gain mastery in all different strokes


This is super interesting coming from a hardcore engineer where specialisation seems to be the thing but craft is honed though creativity and exploration.


I‚Äôve been listening to the epic games CEO on lexfridman, i knew that he had been against apple‚Äôs store monopoly but i did not know about his background.
