While trying to learn about setting keyboard shortcuts via vanilla javascript, I learned that
`navigator.platform` showed  `MacIntel`  despite my device being a post 2020 Apple M2 Pro .

I was confused. I needed to know if I should be.


Turns out that I needn't because there was this thing called Rosetta 2 that was intentionally returning `MacIntel` because it supported applications compiled to run on previously intended Intel X86 chips on now Apple owned silicon stack.

I was almost certain that @digitalocean had a way to configure event alerts using webhooks.

after a clunky search, any attempt to land on an opportunity on closing this requirement led me to a haven of expectations or just ideas dot digitalocean dot com.

like what even?


The aforementioned haven of expectations:

Running notes from [Software is changing (again)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ)

software 1.0 -> computer code
software 2.0 -> language model weights

Software 2.0 is eating Software 1.0


A lot of software 1.0 or even 2.0 is being rewritten.


> "LLMs are people spirits"

a time machine gone wrong (if you will)


LLMs are like a person when their character-arc is complete.


LLMs generate while humans need to verify (as of today)

Going forward we gotta (as humans) setup systems that are intuitive, easy to modify and use. Fast recognition of LLM induced BS.


Karpathy's Slide:

>1. describe single, next concrete, >incremental change
>2. don't ask for code, ask for approaches
>3. test
>4. git commit
>5. ask for suggestion on what could be implemented next
>6. repeat


vague prompts implies vague verification bias. spend time strengthening verification. prompts get stronger as a result.


So test driven development with more steps but when done right, we can get a lot more done. 
many people will not like this and they'd spend money üí∞ to get it done for them. good business opportunity.


however being money minded without having the tenacity to solve the problem will lead to blow up. consumers of such businesses/solutions should decide before jumping in on the hype. -- [üèûÔ∏è Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_XGHMZbD.png) -- 2025-06-19T03:42:21.003Z
