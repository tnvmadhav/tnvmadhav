Uncle Bob on SQL

> SQL was never intended to be used by computer programs. It was a console language for printing reports. Embedding it into programs was one of the gravest errors of our industry.

the only thing about A.I. prompting that bothers me is that I'm not thinking... 

i'm not in flow state. 

it's like im constantly being interrupted by slop. 

i don't mind being wrong and retrying...

it's always like here's the requirement, here's the function signature, now give full function. I just copy and paste, test, review, git commit.

it's lovely for small bug fixes, not great for learning something.

i get why technical founders who are looking to increase customer-value per effort really love it. 

using A.I. forces you to be an owner looking for value. 

the denominator is falling exponentially. i need to change by mindset.  -- 2025-07-25T13:09:05.699Z

Quoting Paul Graham on starting a software startup:

> If you want to start a software startup, you should still learn to program. Even if AI writes most of your code, you'll still be in the position of an engineering manager, and to be a good engineering manager you have to be a programmer yourself.

> But there's another even more important reason to learn to program. That's how you get ideas for startups: when you look around the world with a programmer's eye, you see all the things that could be built but haven't been yet.

If you have the ability to exercise agency, you will find a way to get things done. The easiest way to get things done is do it first in your head.

advice to young kids by john carmack:

>"knowledge and depth"
>"through and through"
>"find inefficiencies that can be bypassed"
>"its not necessary, be reliable, do quality work"
>"but people who do have inclination to doing things deeper, there are layers of things out there, it's amazing"
>"it's better than ever"
>"whole new worlds to explore"
>"hard work, understand as much as you can"
>"you will make more total progress, by telling yourself that there is a whole broad world around me"
>"preparing myself with broad tools and im being aware of change"
>"looking for opportunies to deploy the tools you've built"
>"go deeper and bypass inefficiencies"
>"make things better"  -- 2025-07-20T14:32:30.407Z

Salvatore Sanfilippo uses Gemini 2.5 Pro / Claude to fix vector set bugs in redis core.

Here are some excerpts that I found interesting:

>The most famous LLMs are not the best. Coding activities should be performed mostly with:
>
>* Gemini 2.5 PRO
>* Claude Opus 4
>
>Gemini 2.5 PRO is, in my experience, semantically more powerful. Can spot more complex bugs, reason about more complex problems. Claude Opus may be better at writing new code sometimes (sometimes not), the user interface is more pleasant, and in general you need at least two LLMs to do some back and forth for complex problems in order to enlarge your (human) understanding of the design space. If you can pick just one, go for Gemini 2.5 PRO.

I have been using only chatGPT whenever I use an LLM to help me get some coding/knowledge work done. Looks like I gotta start using Gemini 2.5 pro now.

> Always be part of the loop by moving code by hand from your terminal to the LLM web interface: this guarantees that you follow every process.
> You are still the coder, but augmented.

I too prefer keeping my llm answers in my terminal or web browser itself.
I don't use A.I. in my IDE (vscode and sometimes neovim) because I like to keep control on what goes in my editor.

back in my day, vibe coding meant copy-pasting code from stackoverflow.

I fed an LLM a journal entry asking it specific questions about different problems I‚Äôve have been facing and after the long discussion, it told one thing that resonated with me:
