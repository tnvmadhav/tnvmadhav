Genuinely think the race to A.G.I. needs the rivalry of this ilk and yes it has begun.

Cal Newport on TikTok[^1]

> When I sign in for the first time, TikTok asks me to choose my interests from a long list illustrated by cheerful emojis. I select ‚ÄúLife Hacks,‚Äù ‚ÄúScience and Education,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSports.‚Äù Then I‚Äôm off. The first video shows the Clemson University baseball team playing an exhibition game against the Savannah Bananas, a professional touring squad. The Clemson infield, for some inscrutable reason, starts dancing. I swipe up. A new video begins, showing someone selecting shoes at a store. The video is only ten seconds long; by the time I‚Äôve finished jotting down some notes, it has already started replaying. I hastily swipe again. The next video plays tranquil music while a car slowly drives toward Yosemite National Park. The algorithm must have noticed that I lingered on the wintry scene: the next video shows someone sweeping snow off a porch with some kind of rotating broom contraption. Then the feed takes a darker turn, which makes me want to scroll even faster. I see a news story about a person being pushed onto subway tracks in Manhattan‚Äîswipe‚Äîa Trump video set to ominous music‚Äîswipe‚Äî‚ÄúTop 15 Most Ghetto High Schools in New Jersey‚Äù‚Äîswipe‚Äîand someone making fun of a server‚Äôs accent in a restaurant. I shut down the app.

But if he were to again, I really hope he doesn't come across "brain rot" ever but a part of me wants him to go down that rabbit hole (and write about how he felt).

"LLMs are awesome and limited"

LLMs are great at things that require relatively lesser effort than generating the input itself[^1].
