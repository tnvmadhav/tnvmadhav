How to learn marketing and sales as a solo entrepreneur?


[BitBasher](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42561176)

> "I built and run a saas product solo (> $500k/year). Honestly, I have never found any advice useful[...]

>[...]My business is b2b and it's a platform for certain kinds of professionals as well as an API that powers many well known businesses.

1. Networking
2. Long Game w/ SEO, Word of Mouth

> "I'd say focus on the long game from day one (blog posts, good marketing pages, etc)."

> "If no one wants to talk to you about it, no one is going to want to pay for it."

I found myself reading the (well-written) [Rules of Software Tutorials](https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/rules-for-software-tutorials/)[^1].

I'd started [publishing guides](https://tnvmadhav.me/guides/) for beginners[^2] and I found some value in the aforementioned post, that I will be inculcating in my future guides.

I'd highly recommend a read if you're a developer planning to write guides or technical documentation.

I think it’s about time where we need be able to build stuff incredibly quickly like physically build infrastructure, incredibly quickly with technology.  -- 2025-01-03T07:00:03.320Z

---

it’s funny that it has to be said this way, but programming today is being mainly used to apply solved problems and build stuff on top of that but believe programming was introduced for different reason, to find solutions to problems that a human brain cannot explore, naturally with ease.  -- 2025-01-03T06:46:27.806Z

"One of my papers got declined today by the journal[...]This paper was also submitted elsewhere, and accepted" -- Terence Tao, [via Mastodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/113721192051328193)

> [...]Because of this, a perception can be created that all of one's peers are achieving either success or controversy, with one's own personal career ending up becoming the only known source of examples of "mundane" failure.  I speculate that this may be a contributor to the "impostor syndrome" that is prevalent in this field (though, again, not widely disseminated, due to the aforementioned reporting bias, and perhaps also due to some stigma regarding the topic).

> Rejection is actually a relatively common occurrence for me, happening once or twice a year on average.

> I find it best not to take these sorts of rejections personally, and move on to other journals, of course after revising the paper to address any issues brought up by the rejection.

John Carmack on LLMs and Interfaces:

> LLM assistants are going to be a good forcing function to make sure all app features are accessible from a textual interface as well as a gui. Yes, a strong enough AI can drive a gui, but it makes so much more sense to just make the gui a wrapper around a command line interface that an LLM can talk to directly. ~ [John Carmack](https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1874124927130886501)

> "The question is will top AIs get better at gui faster than all apps add text. I think I have a guess" - [Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1874150440289657237)

> "There will probably be more conventional software written in the coming decade than ever before; the architecture of that software still matters! Better and worse affordances for AI should make a difference." - [John Carmack](https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1874491960737792172)

When developing software, we tend to generally first try to build a Linux program that works on the terminal via CLI command, etc, with the intention of running unit tests like preliminary runs to satisfy the human mind.

Then, we integrate the said feature into whatever the product is.

This thread reminds me of Stripe's DEV console CLI experience where every action that is possible via GUI can also be done via the Stripe CLI tool.

So building tools and apps must be looked at as layers/ levels where level 1 is a functional CLI app and level 2 is a GUI that is catered to a human being and their ease of use. -- [🏞️ Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_nbjr7EI.png) -- 2025-01-01T16:44:42.771Z

Guillermo Rauch, CEO of Vercel published a DOOM game-based captcha.

Kill 3 enemies to pass the captcha.

Surprisingly difficult if you move away from the spawn point.

[doom-captcha.vercel.app](https://doom-captcha.vercel.app)

There's a "How it works" section but there doesn't seem to be a hard link to this section because it's all controlled by Javascript (spectacular RauchG fashion :wink: :wink:) but [here's the source code](https://github.com/rauchg/doom-captcha)


Here's an X post by RauchG

I just stumbled upon a short and sweet post [via Hacker News](https://allenpike.com/2024/an-unreasonable-amount-of-time)

It's essentially a note about getting started with something and a mindset to keep going forward.

This post served as a good reminder to envision growth in the next quarter of the 21st century.

A few points inspired from the post:

1. Start small because expecting a big change will be overwhelming to the pondering mind

2. It's okay even if you try to copy others because unconsciously and fortunately, you'll eventually add your spin onto it, and with the aid of time, whatever you're nurturing will turn out into something unique

3. What looks like overnight success for others, is just an insane amount of work and discipline put behind the scene

4. The effort someone who is at a stage you're striving towards has put will be more or less in the same ballpark as how much you will have to put so no point in comparing yourself to others

> Sometimes magic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect.
