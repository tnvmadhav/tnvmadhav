Some text snippets from the white paper on reading comprehension on plain paper vs on a screen

> "If texts are longer than a page, scrolling and the lack of spatiotemporal markers of the digital texts to aid memory and reading comprehension might impede reading performance."

> "...Hence, we cannot say whether the visual ergonomics of the laptop computer screens hurt subjects‚Äô reading. In future studies, employing online measures including eye tracking methods would appropriately address this important issue."

> ".... Scrolling is known to hamper the process of reading, by imposing a spatial instability which may negatively affect the reader‚Äôs mental representation of the text and, by implication, comprehension."

TIL configuring and using custom bash/shell functions on Linux/Unix systems. I use overly long commands almost daily, so a short and crisp shell function boosts productivity.

All this while, I'd been using command line auto-complete to run overly long shell commands to perform daily tasks ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è smh -- 2024-09-16T03:22:22.168Z

## How do you organize work as a solo developer?

I've tried Notion Databases. It's great to see history of projects. Notion feels clunky nowadays but ok.

For simple, lightweight, fast organisation, I'd recommend maintaining a single file as a todo list.

A file per project. This can be markdown (todo.md) with checkboxes or just a simple todo.txt

This helps you add/edit stuff to the list rather quickly.

This is no answer. Just do things.
