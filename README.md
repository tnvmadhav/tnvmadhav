I came across the term "impedance mismatch" when revisiting the concept of demultiplexing. 

It turns out that the term is used in multiple contexts like in database management, demultiplexing (and now in just about anything that involves comparison of expectation vs reality).

A nice post[^1] on dealing with large codebases in general:

> Summary
> - Large codebases are worth working in because they usually pay your salary
> - By far the most important thing is consistency
> - Never start a feature without first researching prior art in the codebase
> - If you don’t follow existing patterns, you better have a very good reason for it
> - Understand the production footprint of the codebase
> - Don’t expect to be able to test every case - instead, rely on monitoring
> - Remove code any chance you get, but be very careful about it
> - Make it as easy as possible for domain experts to catch your mistakes
