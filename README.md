An A.I. agent that is trained on your taste.
You tell it what you want (regularly or just ad-hoc), and give it constraints if you're in a hurry.
It scours the web, finds links, measures as per your taste, and gives you a compilation.
You should be able to let it know what taste you'd like to develop.
Inherit this agent and deploy it to learning, shopping, exploring, etc.

In short, it is all aspects of life that you want to grow in.  -- 2025-01-05T04:04:00.072Z

I really don't know why but this snippet reminds me of the phrase

"[...]an unstoppable force meets an immovable object"

Not because I think there is a 1:1 mapping to this phrase but reminiscence.

How to learn marketing and sales as a solo entrepreneur?


[BitBasher](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42561176)

> "I built and run a saas product solo (> $500k/year). Honestly, I have never found any advice useful[...]

>[...]My business is b2b and it's a platform for certain kinds of professionals as well as an API that powers many well known businesses.

1. Networking
2. Long Game w/ SEO, Word of Mouth

> "I'd say focus on the long game from day one (blog posts, good marketing pages, etc)."

> "If no one wants to talk to you about it, no one is going to want to pay for it."

I found myself reading the (well-written) [Rules of Software Tutorials](https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/rules-for-software-tutorials/)[^1].

I'd started [publishing guides](https://tnvmadhav.me/guides/) for beginners[^2] and I found some value in the aforementioned post, that I will be inculcating in my future guides.

I'd highly recommend a read if you're a developer planning to write guides or technical documentation.


[^1]: which I found on visiting [the front page of hacker news.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42574641 )

[^2]: Or just... me in a couple of years where I might be needing a refresher.

I think it’s about time where we need be able to build stuff incredibly quickly like physically build infrastructure, incredibly quickly with technology.  -- 2025-01-03T07:00:03.320Z

it’s funny that it has to be said this way, but programming today is being mainly used to apply solved problems and build stuff on top of that but believe programming was introduced for different reason, to find solutions to problems that a human brain cannot explore, naturally with ease.  -- 2025-01-03T06:46:27.806Z

"One of my papers got declined today by the journal[...]This paper was also submitted elsewhere, and accepted" -- Terence Tao, [via Mastodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/113721192051328193)

> [...]Because of this, a perception can be created that all of one's peers are achieving either success or controversy, with one's own personal career ending up becoming the only known source of examples of "mundane" failure.  I speculate that this may be a contributor to the "impostor syndrome" that is prevalent in this field (though, again, not widely disseminated, due to the aforementioned reporting bias, and perhaps also due to some stigma regarding the topic).

> Rejection is actually a relatively common occurrence for me, happening once or twice a year on average.

> I find it best not to take these sorts of rejections personally, and move on to other journals, of course after revising the paper to address any issues brought up by the rejection.
