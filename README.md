Notes from ["In Support of Shitty Types"](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/8/4/shitty-types/) by Mitsuhiko

> Go‚Äôs types are much less expressive and very structural. Things conform to interfaces purely by having certain methods. The LLM does not need to understand much to comprehend that. Also, the types that Go has are rather strictly enforced. If they are wrong, it won‚Äôt compile. Because Go has a much simpler type system that doesn‚Äôt support complicated constructs, it works much better‚Äîboth for LLMs to understand the code they produce and for the LLM to understand real-world libraries you might give to an LLM.

one mustn't forget that if interface{} and type-casting are used, they can still lead to runtime errors. This post primarily speaks about compile-time efficiencies.

Armin ends the post with a very interesting commentary:

> I think it‚Äôs an interesting question whether this behavior of LLMs today will influence future language design. I don‚Äôt know if it will, but I think it gives a lot of credence to some of the decisions that led to languages like Go and Java. As critical as I have been in the past about their rather simple approaches to problems and having a design that maybe doesn‚Äôt hold developers in a particularly high regard, I now think that they actually are measurably in a very good spot. There is more elegance to their design than I gave it credit for.

I believe A.I. can be a lens to appreciate/depreciate decisions whose value that may not have been fully evident.  -- 2025-08-05T17:30:02.819Z

‚Äúyou can either spend $100/mo on groceries or claude max and only one of those is going to make you a millionaire‚Äù

replace subjects and numbers with anything and that‚Äôs a good argument.

it brings out two things:

1. it takes away the focus from lower limit onto the upper limit

2. sprinkles specificity and subjectivity

arguments against don‚Äôt seem to hold for the person making the statement in a acute perspective.

Paul Graham writes all his essays in vim.
