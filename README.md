it suddenly struck me that sustained self vigilance stops becoming a battle with the elimination of self imposed, limiting lens and that trigger to change isn’t always a moment in time but can be (and is initially) relentless sustained vigilance across several contiguous moments in time.  -- 2025-04-06T08:42:39.893Z

working on the slopes instead of the y-intercepts is the secret to optimism.  -- 2025-04-06T08:19:57.893Z

I witnessed a guy build a functional piano in his FPS game. 

This dude is a legend. You have to leave being inspired.

notes to self based on what i've observed:

if you think you're slipping up often, try to spend more time and energy staying as low level as possible.

low level execution punctuated by high level calibration.

I came across an impressive thing while sipping my morning coffee.

A dude behind a twitter account (@PJaccetturo) generated the 'Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring' trailer in the style of Studio Ghibli (and it's pretty impressive to reiterate).

The A.I. Filmmaker shared how the trailer was made.

> My process was:
> Screenshot all 102 shots in the trailer
> Remix them to Ghibli style in @OpenAI's Sora Animate in @Kling_ai and @LumaLabsAI
 >
> Re-edit in sync with trailer.

I'm attaching a hyperlink to the tweet that contains the generated trailer:

Right now, it's possible to do incredible stuff by duct-taping a bunch of tools together. I only see this method getting easier and easier as more people do nice and wholesome things with them.  -- 2025-03-28T03:37:56.858Z

The cost of doing code reviews is the obligatory burden of the whole context loaded in your brain before you start reviewing.

I try to take it as a self enforceable rule. It's the least you can do.

It's crazy that this has to be explicit.  -- 2025-03-25T09:35:22.557Z

While skimming through Simon's list of posts[^1], I realised that I've found the term that I'd been looking for --  "Semantic Diffusion" (where the original idea/meaning dampens with time/loose adoption)

> Semantic diffusion occurs when you have a word that is coined by a person or group, often with a pretty good definition, but then gets spread through the wider community in a way that weakens that definition. This weakening risks losing the definition entirely - and with it any usefulness to the term.
