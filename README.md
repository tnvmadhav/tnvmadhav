If this doesn't make you go "hell yeah" or "hell no", you're not on the spectrum because there is no spectrum here.

The funny thing about the human perception of hard work is that the apparent hurdle to subsequent attempts to utter failures is not a psychological one.  -- 2024-11-03T13:05:54.130Z

A chunk of my public content feed via my content publisher system goes along with media (mostly images). Sometimes the media attachments contain a significant amount of context that may be lost with text only compilation.

So I decided to send static media links of images/assets hosted on my content publisher application to [my public feed](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/tnvmadhav/stream/).

This feed is used by several feed renders that are live on [my blog site](https://tnvmadhav.me)[1] , [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/tnvmadhav)[2] and my post archiver cronjob. -- [üèûÔ∏è Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_6mxvqqe.png) [üèûÔ∏è Context #2](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_1j0fmyM.png) -- 2024-11-03T03:30:23.369Z

A small % of iPhone 14 plus phones have a camera hardware issue.

Apple says it or an Authorized Service Provider could service your phone for free.

Some conditions apply but you can check with your iPhone‚Äôs serial number on [Apple‚Äôs support page](https://support.apple.com/iphone-14-plus-service-program-for-rear-camera-issue)

[via The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285851/some-iphone-14-plus-phones-have-a-camera-issue-but-apple-may-fix-it-for-free)


I‚Äôve had a similar issue but with the iPhone 13 series where the display hardware was faulty and Apple Authorized Service Provider verified and fixed it for free.

I‚Äôd written and shared a post about it and you can read about [my experience on my blog](https://tnvmadhav.me/blog/white-screen-of-death-on-my-iphone/ ).  -- 2024-11-02T08:30:05.489Z

A successful founder gets things done.

A person who has an intense *want* will find ways to get things done.  

This intensity comes from life experiences.

Bad childhood can build character and lead to strong *wants*.

See where the road converges?

I spent some time to make some significant performance improvements (low hanging) to my blog. 

The lighthouse score on the mobile looks pretty good now.

I'd also run [a scan](https://radar.cloudflare.com/scan/956526a3-8907-43a8-b445-051873a77989/summary) on @cloudflare's radar tool and found that total bytes score was less than 512kB.

This means that my little site has (unofficially) entered the [512kb.club](https://512kb.club) ü•≥

I [opened a pull request](https://github.com/kevquirk/512kb.club/pull/1661) to make it official. Fingers crossed ü§ûüèª -- [üèûÔ∏è Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_tiE1nZK.png) -- 2024-11-01T15:46:09.891Z

I'm experimenting with chatgpt's ability to count calories of the food and suggest wait time before having the next meal.

1. Click picture of food
2. Send to chatGPT
3. Receive rough time gap in hours
3. Set a timer to wait before having next meal -- [üèûÔ∏è Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/calorie-genie-demo.gif) -- 2024-11-01T12:29:27.349Z
