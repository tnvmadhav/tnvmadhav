"Art" as we know it "could" become replicable (non-lossy).

And this is totally subjective, but in a world where every art is replicable, the question as what is the "new art" becomes bigger.

I believe for better or worse, "we" could be grandfathered in.

"Mistakes are a portal to creativity" -- Cillian Murphy on working with Christopher Nolan and experiences in his film set. He implies that most of brilliant moments on the cinema screen are a result of capturing those lightning in the bottle moments.

I was fortunate to come across a documentation of one such example in [a tweet](https://x.com/NolanAnalyst/status/1857381028614066570) from a Nolan specific Fan account.

John Carmack writes about his (visibly) weird a game engine debugging dream and he suspects that the game engine must‚Äôve been written in C++ and the bug could‚Äôve been a uninitialised variable without doing an RCA.

A level domain knowledge in anything that leaves you guessing causes of uncommon scenarios in most cases is desirable.

It's not everyday something like [this](https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/1857114106928718329) happens.

Opportunities come and go. You have to catch and squeeze it dry. It's like catching lightning in a bottle. This happens rarely but you know it when it's happening. You get into the zone. 

Sometimes you feel something strong is approaching but you know you're not skilled enough to properly make use of the opportunity.

The only solution is to keep improving such that the chances of missing out on sure-shot opportunities due to mere "skill issue" are drastically curtailed.

The next big thing is either approaching quickly or is already here.

> my answer to the usual question of "what's next?": I don't know! Because if I did, I'd already be half-way done doing it. And then it wouldn't really be next, it'd be now.
>
> Finding the next now is the art of wandering, and wandering well takes practice and patience. Don't rush it.

Two huge podcast episodes dropped this week:

‚Äî [Interview with Dario Amodei by Lex Fridman](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4)

It‚Äôs about time Anthropic‚Äôs C.E.O. got into the limelight to fan the flame that is the narrative of journey to A.G.I. I had recently read his essay and hopefully he talks more about it on lex fridman.

‚Äî [Interview with Gwern Branwen by Dwarkesh Patel](https://youtu.be/a42key59cZQ)

This one caught me by surprise, I thought he finally did a face reveal when I first saw it in my feed only to know both voice and avatar were modulated.

I‚Äôve been a long time fan of his famous essays at gwern.net and this one is gonna be an all timer.

TIL about a YAML file validation using `yq` command line tool.

If you have a .{YAML/YML} file, you can run `yq eval -v {path/to/file}` to do a quick verification on the file format.

Damn the latest mkbhd video getting a lot of comments like this but speeding in school zone isn‚Äôt just a misdemeanour.

The section of the video was cut out and people are getting angrier because of this.


Ok, [he apologised](https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1856456570420257166)

"Struggling to document your TILs not because you're learning so many new things but you're balancing a backlog load of them and churning mental load in retrospect" isn't something one should be comfortable with.  -- 2024-11-06T11:00:02.988Z
