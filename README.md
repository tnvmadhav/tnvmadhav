I came across a low-key diabolical quote:

The sooner you test ideas, the more time you waste holding on to it before you realise it wasn't the best of the ideas.

The best ideas come with a significant volume of lame or laughable ones.  -- 2025-09-01T10:19:07.282Z

What is the loss function you‚Äôre optimizing for in this day and age, fellow traveller?  -- 2025-08-31T06:30:02.890Z

Perhaps the meaning of life is just to minimize context-switch per scroll function in the roaring twenties.  -- 2025-08-30T13:52:49.223Z

Go for it. Don‚Äôt be afraid. Nobody cares. Even if they do, they‚Äôre just people.

> ‚ÄúI get it; ideas are hard to come by. If you let the X timeline brain rot you, you‚Äôll have same 3 ideas everyone has else has.

I‚Äôve been dealing with similar thoughts on social media in general.

Social media like X with algorithmic feed can end up becoming echo chambers. It‚Äôs not bad or wrong.

Suhail shares this sentiment after opening the following rant.

> we do not need another loveable clone


> Why is the world configured in such a manner?

> These are not inherently startup ideas but if you can ask why and follow thread long enough you will find broken opportunities everywhere. 

True.

> Most people don‚Äôt even ask why.

Many do actually but the trail is left sooner than later onto the next thing.

Maybe just maybe the meaning of life is getting the next idea and learning (ideally the hard way) that it's not that good. 
Because it's stochastic knowledge that most ideas a not that good. 

So sooner you learn why your next idea isn't good enough the sooner you land on a really good one.
