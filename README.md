Today I learned that the generic function with multiple implementations based on the types of the a single arguments are called as single dispatch functions.

I'm dropping a reference to the mention on [__*the official python 3 documentation*__](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-single-dispatch)  -- 2025-10-20T04:40:13.342Z

I too speak faster than I think and this is similar to explanation I give to my peers 😂😭😭

Shipping with assertion turned on, should ideally be done from the projects' inception and not when project is already being used by customers.

The point I'm trying to make is that if you and you're team are still working on fast iteration cycles and aren't there yet, you can slowly adapt to using asserts in production code, and not all at once.


Turning asserts on in production codebase is definitely a way to help team build fast iteration cycles in terms of Nth order effects.

They learn (or) you go belly up. You choose. It's a do or die thing.  -- 2025-10-17T08:50:20.963Z

Typing manually is layer 1 and boilerplate generation is the prime subject to building additional layers.

Code generation tools are just a convenience layer to help when we’re constrained on resources like time, brain power etc.

Code generation can be used to automate testing boilerplate and test case transcription. 

The test cases themselves could ideally be handwritten or designed to keep the context in the operators’ flow states.

# TIL How to open any file in browser from the terminal

I always knew we could open any file in the browser on my Mac but I didn't know how.
Today I did and it's super simple.

> open -a Safari notes.txt

It's the same for any file. Here's an example of a markdown file:

> open -a Safari notes.md


## Side note
This knowledge opens a way to better deal with situations in real life. Like,
if we have a markdown previewer extension on the browser of our choice, then
it's super useful during demos and presentations where we can keep the text  editor and 
preview windows decoupled from each other.

Ideally, we don't want to have two applications but have a single app showing
editing and previewing mode.

## Visual Studio Code is a great alternative
The existing solution is to use Visual Studio Code. with the inbuilt preview markdown  feature. 
Command + Shift + V to preview the existing markdown file. It's great for most use-cases. 

If you need a simpler setup, one can use Neovim plugins. They are generally faster than electron app based
solutions (not that it matters a lot but the inner purists in use can  disagree).   -- 2025-10-09T07:54:47.495Z

One doesn’t simply get handed fast feedback loops off the bat.
