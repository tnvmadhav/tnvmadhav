If your AWS deployments seem unnecessarily slow, you could do something about it.

I've found a [well-written piece](https://nathanpeck.com/speeding-up-amazon-ecs-container-deployments/) that could help. -- 2024-09-27T12:30:03.052Z

TIL configuring and using custom bash/shell functions on Linux/Unix systems. I use overly long commands almost daily, so a short and crisp shell function boosts productivity.

All this while, I'd been using command line auto-complete to run overly long shell commands to perform daily tasks ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è smh -- 2024-09-16T03:22:22.168Z

## How do you organize work as a solo developer?

I've tried Notion Databases. It's great to see history of projects. Notion feels clunky nowadays but ok.

For simple, lightweight, fast organisation, I'd recommend maintaining a single file as a todo list.

A file per project. This can be markdown (todo.md) with checkboxes or just a simple todo.txt

This helps you add/edit stuff to the list rather quickly.

This is no answer. Just do things.

TIL that there's a whole package (I mean it was obvious in-retrospect) called `Charts` in SwiftUI. [^1] 

I was experimenting with bar graphs and charts (for an iOS app - hobby project) and was planning on raw dogging rectangles (ik LMFAO).

But now the Charts package can help cut down on time. I'm yet to dive deep but it looks super easy (thanks to SwiftUI's simplicity) but I'm sure I can get results faster.

After playing with Bar Graphs and referring to example implementations [^2], I noticed that one could create the same types of charts baked in iOS apps like screentime, health, etc support.

This is great news (in general but) especially for backend developers like myself who are dabbling with design and client-side application development for (limited scope) hobby projects.

If this happens to anyone on @X, you should immediately log in to x.com and go to [Sessions page](https://x.com/settings/apps_and_sessions) and check if this is true. 

If you're still unsure, click `log out all other sessions` button only via the official x.com app/website's sessions page.

Keep safe!
