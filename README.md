This doesn‚Äôt need to be said but There is so much compressed into this single sentence. Hopes of mankind. 

If 2020s had a lesson, I must say this is a good reminder that one can try and learn a lot with A.I. assistants patiently helping you out.

I‚Äôve always wanted idea threads that easy to use. I try to use Excalidraw to create chain of ideas rendered as bubbles / nodes in a network.

I can‚Äôt help but think about the new Pocket hardware that launched this week. 

One catch phrase caught my attention. ‚ÄúConversation threads‚Äù if I remember it correctly.

This could help me out but I can‚Äôt say for sure. 

Sometimes I wanna build it from scratch ü•π because i genuinely believe being able to navigate idea chains without losing context is crucial in my professional life as of yet.  -- 2024-12-20T08:16:42.469Z

I use A.I. to warm up the execution process on task chains planned beforehand.

Still majority of time is still spent problem solving (using brain üß† ) that finally involving the aforementioned task chains

My brain still hasn‚Äôt fully accepted Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor.

Might not be the best casting decision but I hope he proves this wrong. -- [üèûÔ∏è Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_LY9FRjZ.png) -- 2024-12-20T02:29:53.889Z

I stumbled upon a succinct piece from Paul Irish, about 'how to enhance website visitor experience on a website using considerable tools at disposal', while continuing my dive into vercel.

The below points to keep the 'why's pickled:

1. Slow TCP ramp up
2. The first 14kb is crucial (because of point 1)
3. Critical CSS for above the fold renders

This talk was referenced in the "7 Principles of Rich Web Applications".


üîó I'm attaching the said "Delivering the goods" talk/keynote in this post for reference:

I found myself revisiting rauchg's 7 principles of rich web applications:

1. Pre-rendering isn't optional
2. React immediately to user input
3. React to data changes (server side included)
4. Control data exchange between client and server
5. Don't break history, enhance it
6. Push code updates (yes client code updates)
7. Predict Behaviour (I honestly think this is overkill ‚Äî but brilliant if pulled off)

This (re-)read was part of my dive into "how vercel ships good quality software so quickly" assumption.


And oh, here's the link to the article from 2014, ‚Äî the examples are really helpful to wrap your mind around the concepts that are seemingly complex (at first).
