One can confidently say that they‚Äôve ‚Äúlearned to learn‚Äù by breathing the fact that real learning happens through living the reality rather than surfing a commentary on said reality.  -- 2024-11-05T06:30:03.143Z

I'm experimenting with chatgpt's ability to count calories of the food and suggest wait time before having the next meal.

1. Click picture of food
2. Send to chatGPT
3. Receive rough time gap in hours
3. Set a timer to wait before having next meal

I've initially thought of using [it in my local machine](https://github.com/tnvmadhav/calorie-genie ) but I immediately realized this is useful to me on the go via my mobile browser.

Since I'd already had a web tools application provisioned up and running. I'd used chatGPT to convert the flask app to a @golang HTTP handler.

I've now exposed it [via the web](https://smolkit.com/calorie-genie/ ).

If this doesn't make you go "hell yeah" or "hell no", you're not on the spectrum because there is no spectrum here.

The funny thing about the human perception of hard work is that the apparent hurdle to subsequent attempts to utter failures is not a psychological one.  -- 2024-11-04T13:00:02.953Z

Can you solve your way through a problem through sheer spaced repetition?  -- 2024-11-04T06:30:03.510Z

A developer knows how straining and  difficult it is to document a debugging session especially in hindsight where a certain optimum spurs out of the void that all suboptimal attempts look pale in comparison so much so that sometimes you start feeling a little embarrassed (I do).

I enjoyed reading and appreciate [this post](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/10/27/asn-ip-address-memory/ ) on improving memory usage performance by @b0rk. Also learned about many packages along the way.

I‚Äôd like to practice doing this more often.  -- 2024-11-04T06:11:31.292Z

Fleeting thoughts influenced by the spark of moments in the universe instead of steady build up of logical implications is the flywheel that trades your time for life experiences.  -- 2024-11-03T12:30:02.989Z

A chunk of my public content feed via my content publisher system goes along with media (mostly images). Sometimes the media attachments contain a significant amount of context that may be lost with text only compilation.

So I decided to send static media links of images/assets hosted on my content publisher application to [my public feed](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/tnvmadhav/stream/).

This feed is used by several feed renders that are live on [my blog site](https://tnvmadhav.me)[1] , [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/tnvmadhav)[2] and my post archiver cronjob. -- [üèûÔ∏è Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_6mxvqqe.png) [üèûÔ∏è Context #2](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_1j0fmyM.png) -- 2024-11-03T03:30:23.369Z

A small % of iPhone 14 plus phones have a camera hardware issue.

Apple says it or an Authorized Service Provider could service your phone for free.

Some conditions apply but you can check with your iPhone‚Äôs serial number on [Apple‚Äôs support page](https://support.apple.com/iphone-14-plus-service-program-for-rear-camera-issue)

[via The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285851/some-iphone-14-plus-phones-have-a-camera-issue-but-apple-may-fix-it-for-free)


I‚Äôve had a similar issue but with the iPhone 13 series where the display hardware was faulty and Apple Authorized Service Provider verified and fixed it for free.

I‚Äôd written and shared a post about it and you can read about [my experience on my blog](https://tnvmadhav.me/blog/white-screen-of-death-on-my-iphone/ ).  -- 2024-11-02T08:30:05.489Z
