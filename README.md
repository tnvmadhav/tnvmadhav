Opportunities come and go. You have to catch and squeeze it dry. It's like catching lightning in a bottle. This happens rarely but you know it when it's happening. You get into the zone. 

Sometimes you feel something strong is approaching but you know you're not skilled enough to properly make use of the opportunity.

The only solution is to keep improving such that the chances of missing out on sure-shot opportunities due to mere "skill issue" are drastically curtailed.

The next big thing is either approaching quickly or is already here.

> my answer to the usual question of "what's next?": I don't know! Because if I did, I'd already be half-way done doing it. And then it wouldn't really be next, it'd be now.

Two huge podcast episodes dropped this week:

‚Äî [Interview with Dario Amodei by Lex Fridman](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4)

It‚Äôs about time Anthropic‚Äôs C.E.O. got into the limelight to fan the flame that is the narrative of journey to A.G.I. I had recently read his essay and hopefully he talks more about it on lex fridman.

‚Äî [Interview with Gwern Branwen by Dwarkesh Patel](https://youtu.be/a42key59cZQ)

This one caught me by surprise, I thought he finally did a face reveal when I first saw it in my feed only to know both voice and avatar were modulated.

I‚Äôve been a long time fan of his famous essays at gwern.net and this one is gonna be an all timer.

TIL about a YAML file validation using `yq` command line tool.

If you have a .{YAML/YML} file, you can run `yq eval -v {path/to/file}` to do a quick verification on the file format.

I really missed gdb's coding tweets. I'm glad to know he is back at @openai shipping software.

Damn the latest mkbhd video getting a lot of comments like this but speeding in school zone isn‚Äôt just a misdemeanour.

The section of the video was cut out and people are getting angrier because of this.


Ok, [he apologised](https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1856456570420257166)

"Struggling to document your TILs not because you're learning so many new things but you're balancing a backlog load of them and churning mental load in retrospect" isn't something one should be comfortable with.  -- 2024-11-06T11:00:02.988Z

notes & excepts from [What you know that just ain't so](https://world.hey.com/dhh/what-you-know-that-just-ain-t-so-ab6f4bb1)

> We don't need to know everything for sure before taking action.

> [...]Convinced that half the opportunities in the world just don't apply to your situation and the other half is a slam dunk. Nonsense.

Unlike school and university, where there is reward to those who focus on rigid inputs and outputs, the real world is absurd. The real world doesn't reward all (apparently equal) attempts equally. There is luck / timing aspect. But the main point remains same, there is trade-off. You MAY become more successful from half knowledge about something than doing it absolutely right.

Don't take anything as gospel. Learn that every bit of success / failure was influenced by the (seeming) absurdity of the world.

It's not a bad day (in business or otherwise) if you're reminded of this.  -- 2024-11-06T06:30:03.156Z

POV you‚Äôre a basic crud app facing a man and his $20/mo cursor subscription.

One can confidently say that they‚Äôve ‚Äúlearned to learn‚Äù by breathing the fact that real learning happens through living the reality rather than surfing a commentary on said reality.  -- 2024-11-05T06:30:03.143Z
