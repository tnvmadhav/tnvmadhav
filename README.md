Someone tried to inject a crypto miner into the ultralytics PyPi package (v8.3.41 & v8.3.42)

While these versions no longer are downloadable, if it already is (cached or otherwise) because you're using it, Please delete those versions / update immediately.

The GitHub issue is still ongoing with what could've been done to avoid this.

Here's a comprehensive writeup by the yossarian (@8x5clPW2) on what happened.

Kendrick Lamar's Link in Bio Page [my-gnx.com](https://my-gnx.com) is hosted on Vercel.

I was wondering if it's because he was using a link in the bio service. If you inspect the dev console, it appears that there is some relation to [Linkfire](https://linkfire.com), but loosely so.

I've finally added my ü¶ã bluesky profile to my 'link in bio' page (bagel.ink/@tnvmadhav)


I took this beautiful iPhone Mockup of my link in the bio page using the WebShotPro iPhone application.

Get it here -> bagel.ink/c/DhLwv0


WebShotPro also generates an editable open graph image of the website based on the HTML metatags -- [üèûÔ∏è Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_0X0mval.png) [üèûÔ∏è Context #2](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_s0XKcuo.png) [üèûÔ∏è Context #3](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/_com.apple.Foundation.NSItemProvider.0asmzr.png) -- 2024-11-23T12:54:48.910Z

Today I learned about the term "Hyrum's Law" in software engineering.

It refers that even though implementation specifics are hidden, breadcrumbs of implementation will be expected to be consistent when there's no apparent change the interface signature.

And any implementation change can and will break a small subset of users' workflow. 

And yes there's an XKCD for it.


Quoting one of Go's package author:

"I wrote the crypto/rsa comments. We take Hyrum's Law (and backwards compatibility [1]) extremely seriously in Go. Here are a couple more examples" - [via HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42202326)
