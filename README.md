I really hope vibe coding stops after going from zero to one.

The term vibe engineering sends shivers down my spine but one man's fear is another man's opportunity.

When push comes to shove, we must be able to turn a vibe coded product to a well engineered sound product and business.

overthinking is anticipating the nth order effect of an action or lack thereof.

overthinking often collapses to a delusion. then, emotional turmoil. 

instead, how about we try to stack actions that seem to yield only positive growth regardless of feedbacks leading to different nth order effects?

then, we're just indirectly limiting decisions to 1st order effects only make things easier on the mind. This curtails  overthinking & its negative effects by several orders.

Not speaking for positive effects of overthinking cuz it's not productive üòÖ for me.  -- 2025-04-25T08:29:05.399Z

For the long term, it's important to know what is actually going on because a project is subject to modifications and extensions.

Speaking of extensions and modifications, vibe coding on the other hand calls for complete rewrite and, though A.I could eventually do a complete rewrite to support further updates. It feels we're disrespecting the G.P.U.s and resources to get things done in a suboptimal way (if you will).

The struggle to not let time (and by generalization, entropy) affect the quality of our actions only gets bigger until it‚Äôs fully internalized by the mind and body.  -- 2025-04-23T07:36:58.589Z

scrolling social media is like incentivising perpetual ephemeral thoughts and ideas.

ideally one should gain something out of it but we ignore going deeper into certain interesting thoughts and instead, keep surfing üèÑ 

that is not why we should use social media.

posters are getting something done and posting about it but consumers are just window-shopping (weird way to put it)  -- 2025-04-18T04:28:15.490Z

I'm strangely attracted to the idea of commit driven development.

Break down the task into list of commits annotated by the commit messages in great detail.

Tackle each of them in sequence.

It helps me keep stick to commit message while doing the changes.


It's like a todo list but specific to low level implementation details.  -- 2025-04-17T07:15:58.092Z
