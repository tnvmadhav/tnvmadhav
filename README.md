I really missed gdb's coding tweets. I'm glad to know he is back at @openai shipping software.

Damn the latest mkbhd video getting a lot of comments like this but speeding in school zone isn‚Äôt just a misdemeanour.

The section of the video was cut out and people are getting angrier because of this.


Ok, [he apologised](https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1856456570420257166)

"Struggling to document your TILs not because you're learning so many new things but you're balancing a backlog load of them and churning mental load in retrospect" isn't something one should be comfortable with.  -- 2024-11-06T11:00:02.988Z

notes & excepts from [What you know that just ain't so](https://world.hey.com/dhh/what-you-know-that-just-ain-t-so-ab6f4bb1)

> We don't need to know everything for sure before taking action.

> [...]Convinced that half the opportunities in the world just don't apply to your situation and the other half is a slam dunk. Nonsense.

Unlike school and university, where there is reward to those who focus on rigid inputs and outputs, the real world is absurd. The real world doesn't reward all (apparently equal) attempts equally. There is luck / timing aspect. But the main point remains same, there is trade-off. You MAY become more successful from half knowledge about something than doing it absolutely right.

Don't take anything as gospel. Learn that every bit of success / failure was influenced by the (seeming) absurdity of the world.

It's not a bad day (in business or otherwise) if you're reminded of this.  -- 2024-11-06T06:30:03.156Z

POV you‚Äôre a basic crud app facing a man and his $20/mo cursor subscription.

One can confidently say that they‚Äôve ‚Äúlearned to learn‚Äù by breathing the fact that real learning happens through living the reality rather than surfing a commentary on said reality.  -- 2024-11-05T06:30:03.143Z

I'm experimenting with chatgpt's ability to count calories of the food and suggest wait time before having the next meal.

1. Click picture of food
2. Send to chatGPT
3. Receive rough time gap in hours
3. Set a timer to wait before having next meal

I've initially thought of using [it in my local machine](https://github.com/tnvmadhav/calorie-genie ) but I immediately realized this is useful to me on the go via my mobile browser.

Since I'd already had a web tools application provisioned up and running. I'd used chatGPT to convert the flask app to a @golang HTTP handler.

I've now exposed it [via the web](https://smolkit.com/calorie-genie/ ).

If this doesn't make you go "hell yeah" or "hell no", you're not on the spectrum because there is no spectrum here.

The funny thing about the human perception of hard work is that the apparent hurdle to subsequent attempts to utter failures is not a psychological one.  -- 2024-11-04T13:00:02.953Z
