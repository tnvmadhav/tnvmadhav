Jack starts [permissionlesstech](https://github.com/permissionlesstech)

> i did this as a weekend project to understand a few technologies: bluetooth mesh, store and forward and relay models, and various encryption models. this was one part of a series of challenges i've given myself: to build something every day that i didn't think i was capable of, and that i didn't think the current set of AI tools were capable of, namely block's tool goose (https://block.github.io/goose/). i'm always surprised at how much...just works. we have a new way of programming now, with an entirely new language and compiler: english and intelligence models.

Brian Armstrong on "Share a piece of lore about yourself"

He shared  a struggle he faced during the early phases of Coinbase. It's a long post, so I'm linking it [here for reference](https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/1942673835381383289).

He ends the story with this,

>  It's a great testament to how constraints breed creativity, top talent matters in startups, and teams are often capable of more than they think when there is no other option.
> Most products that succeed have early moments like this, where someone has to step up and make a play on the field that defies all the odds. As we face new challenges and deadlines across our many products, I always look out for who on the team is ready to step up and make the game-winning play on the field.

I do recommend that you read his entire post.  -- 2025-07-09T03:25:54.394Z

Watching a video is like skimming the material where by the end, you'll know where it's all headed and the mind is already working on recognizing the independent points of agency, a traversal in the graph if you will.


Then as a second pass, slowing re-reading the transcript to help the mind affirm/reaffirm or even break assumptions, is gonna have a lasting impact in the learning process.


This explains why I remember random lore/moments in stories I adore. Watch something end to end and then meticulously revisit parts with a new perspective (akin to multimodal recall).

I might have to experiment with daily setup and teardown rituals because mission critical work can be energy draining.  -- 2025-07-03T08:39:13.146Z

i wrote myself a neovim command and a keybinding on top of that to help me save and push the current file to remote git branch.

If I want to quickly save current file and push to remote all i need to do it

This is super helpful when working with personal single file notes and scripts.

>  The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard by Mueller and Oppenheimer found that students who took handwritten notes retained concepts better than those who typed them. 

Taking notes in your own words along with verbatim (quotes) and can help later validate and rethink your assumptions.

Hand writing in your own words + digital / analog verbatim transcribing i feel is in line with the Lollapalooza[^1]


[^1]: "Lollapalooza effect: Munger used the term "Lollapalooza effect" for multiple biases, tendencies or mental models acting in compound with each other at the same time in the same direction. With the Lollapalooza effect, itself a mental model, the result is often extreme, due to the confluence of the mental models, biases or tendencies acting together, greatly increasing the likelihood of acting irrationally" ~ [via wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger)  -- 2025-06-28T05:12:55.521Z
