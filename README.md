I decided to give in and setup a @clawdbot daemon today for fun. Remotely on a fresh ec2 instance.

Apart from some hurdles, i got it working via telegram trigger.

I see the vision, have some ideas and yes we’re getting close.

Remote personal agents. Cambrian explosion. I see it.  -- 2026-01-25T12:31:07.842Z

Today, I shall try to do things that I couldn’t even attempt yesterday.  -- 2026-01-18T13:00:02.583Z

Following the pictorial trend on the idea of Roko's Basilisk, I asked chatGPT to generate an image on how I’d treated it.

You perform the best with a controlled amount of healthy stress.

Too much or too little stress can have negative consequences. 

Practice and know your levels and limits.  -- 2026-01-18T06:30:02.716Z

On Claude getting too myopic when working with large codebases

“A skillful driver can mitigate this, but most lack the skill”

“Just two missing characters in a Regex filter allowed unauthenticated attackers to infiltrate the build environment and leak privileged credentials”

This is a well written disclosure document 👍

I just installed opencode using the “oh-my-opencode” wrapper and asked it to add a feature which I wanted to build in my side project, and guess what… in just 2 big shots, it was able to make a working version of it with minor tweaks from my side.

The value add is insane!  -- 2026-01-10T09:36:15.738Z

> It genuinely feels to me like GPT-5.2 and Opus 4.5 in November represent an inflection point - one of those moments where the models get incrementally better in a way that tips across an invisible capability line where suddenly a whole bunch of much harder coding problems open up
> It's possible Gemini 3 Pro should be included in that group as well, but I'm not seeing quite the same level of astonished buzz from hardened software engineers around that model as I am for the other two .

I am currently unable to add images to GitHub issues :(

Is this an outage?
https://www.githubstatus.com says otherwise


Posted about it on X

Ah, got it. The image file was too big (>10MB)

I tried to add the file in a pull request and the error response told me this.

All good. Perhaps the issue was that the error response in @GitHub actions is different from pull requests. -- [🏞️ Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_BAN87tk.png) -- 2025-12-31T06:29:15.226Z
