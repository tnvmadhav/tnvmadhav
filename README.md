I am convinced that most inefficiencies are due to a lack of robust setup and teardown routines or their implementations.  -- 2025-08-28T15:30:02.810Z

If you're not able to communicate your state of mind about something in a RESTful way, you're likely doing it wrong.

Because this could lead to jarring results rooting back to this miscommunication incident.


People arguing that sharing written pieces is the way to prevent this because being verbose and redundant in somethings works really well but the point is we gotta ensure the information reaches and is processed in their brains the way you intended it.

So written pieces make it easy for the author to place it all on the table but it doesn't guarantee that the reading happens the way you intended it to.

This can be fixed with technology. Introducing multi-modality. A layer on top of the written piece.


A video of you explaining it the way you wanna intend it. Or even an audio piece.

If writing is layer 1, then video, audio can be a layer 2 and layer 3. Looking at problems like this can help appreciate technology more and more everyday.

NotebookLM product sort of attempts to solve this but nothing is as good as the original author attempting to convey the same thing through many modalities.  -- 2025-08-28T12:30:07.853Z

Excerpt from contributing guidelines from Ghostty repository:

> In a perfect world, AI assistance would produce equal or higher quality
work than any human. That isn't the world we live in today, and in most cases it's generating slop. I say this despite being a fan of and using them
successfully myself (with heavy supervision)!

I've implemented individual post archival per day so each post can be linked to independently.

@GoHugoIO is amazing for post archival management.
