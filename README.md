>  The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard by Mueller and Oppenheimer found that students who took handwritten notes retained concepts better than those who typed them. 

Taking notes in your own words along with verbatim (quotes) and can help later validate and rethink your assumptions.

Hand writing in your own words + digital / analog verbatim transcribing i feel is in line with the Lollapalooza[^1]


[^1]: "Lollapalooza effect: Munger used the term "Lollapalooza effect" for multiple biases, tendencies or mental models acting in compound with each other at the same time in the same direction. With the Lollapalooza effect, itself a mental model, the result is often extreme, due to the confluence of the mental models, biases or tendencies acting together, greatly increasing the likelihood of acting irrationally" ~ [via wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger)  -- 2025-06-28T05:12:55.521Z

Rosetta 2 creator on efficiency:

> Q(zmb_ ): [...]As someone frustrated in a team of 10+ that is struggling to ship even seemingly trivial things due to processes and overheads and inefficiencies, I would really appreciate some insights on how do you organize the work to allow a single developer to achieve this.

> A(cwzwarich): Well, the first thing to realize about scaling codebases with developers is that an N developer team will usually produce a codebase that requires N developers to maintain. So by starting small and staying small until you reach a certain critical mass of fundamental decisions, you can avoid some of the problems that you get from having too many developers too early. You can easily also fall into the reverse trap: a historical core with pieces that fit too well together, but most of the developers on the team don’t intuitively understand the reasons behind all of the past decisions (because they weren’t there when they happened). This can lead to poorly affixed additions to a system in response to new features or requirements.
As far as Rosetta in particular was concerned, I think I was just in the right environment to consistently be in a flow state. I have had fleeting moments of depression upon the realization that I will probably never be this productive for an extended period of time ever again.

I rewatched Manchester by the Sea last night.

Casey Affleck really did a phenomenal job portraying unease and depression but Michelle Williams stole every scene she was in.

Moreover what kept me fascinated was the portrayal of climate/weather metaphorically *and* literally carrying the emotional journey *and* plot respectively.

The latter which is something that stood out to me because I've been dabbling with such metaphors in a story I've been brewing in my head.  -- 2025-06-26T02:55:44.675Z

I've been doing this *fun* thing lately.

Whenever I recall a concept that is practically not relevant to what I'm doing in my daily life (you can call me a normie) and I wanna see how people are dealing with said concept in their daily lives, I do this simple trick.

I search  `site:news.ycombinator.com {{concept}}` on google and honestly I'm not disappointed. Instant rabbit hole material.


all this given that I have time to kill :P  -- 2025-06-26T02:45:22.954Z

Excerpts from "The Shape of the Essay Field" https://paulgraham.com/field.html

> So the three reasons readers might not already know what you tell them are (a) that it's not important, (b) that they're obtuse, or (c) that they're inexperienced.

so by implication,

>  If you're writing for smart people about important things, you're writing for the young.


> Now that I know it, should I change anything? I don't think so. In fact seeing the shape of the field that writers work in has reminded me that I'm not optimizing for returns in it. I'm not trying to surprise readers of any particular age; I'm trying to surprise myself.  -- 2025-06-24T04:08:40.622Z

While trying to learn about setting keyboard shortcuts via vanilla javascript, I learned that
`navigator.platform` showed  `MacIntel`  despite my device being a post 2020 Apple M2 Pro .

I was confused. I needed to know if I should be.


Turns out that I needn't because there was this thing called Rosetta 2 that was intentionally returning `MacIntel` because it supported applications compiled to run on previously intended Intel X86 chips on now Apple owned silicon stack.
