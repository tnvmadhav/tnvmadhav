I asked chatGPT help understand OpenAI’s PBC transition:

WHAT IS A PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION (PBC)?

A Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) is a legal for-profit corporate form that requires
directors to balance financial interests of shareholders with a stated public benefit(s).
It blends profit motive with an explicit mission (e.g., social, environmental, educational).
PBCs typically have extra transparency and reporting obligations and may embed the
public benefit into governance documents.


STRUCTURE & KEY PARTS OF A PBC

- For-profit entity: Operates to make profit and can raise capital like a normal corporation.
- Public benefit statement: A clear, often legally required statement of the specific public benefit(s) the company aims to pursue.
- Board of directors' duties: Directors must consider both shareholder value and the public benefit; decisions should reflect a balance.
- Accountability & reporting: Many jurisdictions require an annual benefit report describing progress on the public benefit.
- Stakeholders: Beyond shareholders — customers, employees, community, environment are legitimate considerations.
- Benefit enforcement: Stakeholders or special benefit directors/inspectors may have standing to enforce benefit obligations depending on jurisdiction.


COMPARISON: PBC vs TRADITIONAL CORP vs NONPROFIT

Characteristic        | PBC                         | Traditional Corporation     | Nonprofit                  
Primary purpose       | Profit + explicit public benefit | Maximize shareholder value | Public benefit (no private profit)
Profit distribution   | Yes (to owners/investors)   | Yes                         | No (surpluses re-invested)  
Legal duty of directors | Balance profit + benefit  | Primarily shareholder value | Advance mission; no private dividends
Raising capital       | Easier (can attract equity) | Easiest                     | Limited (grants, donations)
Transparency/reporting| Often required (benefit report) | Typically financial only   | Often high mission reporting

Note: exact duties and enforcement depend on jurisdiction (state/country law).


EXAMPLE PBC OBJECT:

SunForAll, Inc. — PBC
Owners: InvestorA(40.0%), Founder1(30.0%), Founder2(20.0%), EmployeesPool(10.0%)
Board: Founder1, Founder2, IndependentDirectorA, BenefitDirector
Benefit: Affordable clean energy access
Description: Increase access to low-cost, low-carbon electricity for low-income communities.
Retained earnings: $120,000.00

CURRENT BENEFIT METRICS (sample values 0..1):
 - reduction_in_cost_per_unit: 0.75
 - access_increase_index: 0.60
 - worker_safety_index: 0.95
 - retention_improvement: 0.50
 - community_outreach: 0.20

SIMULATION: Decisions balancing profit vs public benefit

Note: Directors must consciously weigh financial outcomes and the declared public benefit.
You can adjust 'weight_profit' and 'weight_benefit' to model different board priorities.

Proposal: Open a new mass-production line
  Estimated profit change: $600,000
  Benefit metric summary: {'reduction_in_cost_per_unit': 0.8, 'access_increase_index': 0.4}
  Combined decision score: 0.650 -> APPROVE

Proposal: Improve workplace safety with expensive retrofit
  Estimated profit change: -150,000
  Benefit metric summary: {'worker_safety_index': 0.95, 'retention_improvement': 0.6}
  Combined decision score: 0.612 -> APPROVE

Proposal: Marketing campaign increasing prices slightly
  Estimated profit change: $200,000
  Benefit metric summary: {'community_outreach': 0.1}
  Combined decision score: 0.425 -> REJECT


FURTHER NOTES / REAL-WORLD POINTS:

- Legal details vary by jurisdiction (e.g., Delaware, other US states, and other countries).
  Some places call similar entities 'benefit corporations' or have different rules.
- Enforcement varies: in some places, shareholders, the benefit director, or other stakeholders
  can bring lawsuits if the company fails to pursue its benefit.
- PBC structure helps align mission-driven founders with investors by making the mission
  a legally protected part of the entity's purpose.
- A PBC does not guarantee success in both profit and benefit; it changes the legal obligations
  and governance to require balancing, and increases transparency/expectations.

The “making it” for variety of things have different time frames.

>  “Fake it until you make it” is often dismissed as shallow, but it’s closer to Franklin’s truth. Faking it long enough is making it. The repetition of behavior, not the sincerity of belief, is what shapes character.

The time frame is dependent on how aligned your honest self is to your phony self[^1]

The browser wars have officially begun and whoever participates is forced to improve the agentic flows and there would be (IMO) a local maxima beyond which prompt injection becomes a catastrophic vector.

If google chooses to not participate, a significant portion of people can choose to migrate off google chrome and google might lose a significant chunk of market share or something idk… only until things go belly up when really bad prompt injection events come to light 

If google chooses to participate, then it’s over. Google chrome has a large market share and this means google will also be cornered into the aforementioned local maxima until damage is already done to small % of affected users. small % but large absolute number.

Prompt injections cannot be stopped until something novels comes about. but for time being it’s not looking good for google (in near term atleast). happy to be wrong about it.

You must’ve heard the “why is my washing machine sending soo much data to cloud?” joke from a few years ago.

Well, now replace ‘washing machine’ with ‘bed’

[Quoting Michael Zimmermann](https://x.com/zimm3rmann/status/1980491408948572167?s=46)

> Is 16+gb/mo a normal amount of telemetry? Can you not do any local compute of “get hot” or “get cold” with a multi core processor and multiple gigabytes of memory? Can’t just repeat the previous nights settings? 
> 
> It’s bad enough that you slapped a $ 200/yr subscription on things, worse that it doesn’t work at all without internet.


This whole thing came to light after many instances of EightSleep mattresses (pods) stopped functioning due to an AWS outage (which is hilarious and horrific at the same time).

This reminds me of a joke (and a truth):

> If you want to know how dependent something is to the world, turn it off
 
A single high-value region on AWS went down recently and several external entities were disrupted and EightSleep pods were one of them.

EightSleep is fine but anything else that’s very critical is not. 

This global incident should be a wake up call for dependent services to plan and support failovers. For consumer products to support offline mode. (either ways for a temp controlled bed to depend on cloud to function normally is ridiculous to a layman).

feature, not a bug

All on-call engineers should be hooked up to @eightsleep pods whose functioning is dependent on current uptime of the services they are up-keeping :)  -- 2025-10-22T04:25:52.737Z

Today I learned that the generic function with multiple implementations based on the types of the a single arguments are called as single dispatch functions.

I'm dropping a reference to the mention on [__*the official python 3 documentation*__](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-single-dispatch)  -- 2025-10-20T04:40:13.342Z

> “… It's to my detriment because sometimes my speaking thread out-executes my thinking thread”

I too speak faster than I think and this is similar to explanation I give to my peers 😂😭😭
