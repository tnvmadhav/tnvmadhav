The cost of doing code reviews is the obligatory burden of the whole context loaded in your brain before you start reviewing.

I try to take it as a self enforceable rule. It's the least you can do.

It's crazy that this has to be explicit.  -- 2025-03-25T09:35:22.557Z

While skimming through Simon's list of posts[^1], I realised that I've found the term that I'd been looking for --  "Semantic Diffusion" (where the original idea/meaning dampens with time/loose adoption)

> Semantic diffusion occurs when you have a word that is coined by a person or group, often with a pretty good definition, but then gets spread through the wider community in a way that weakens that definition. This weakening risks losing the definition entirely - and with it any usefulness to the term.

I've always had an appreciation to teams that ship products and features at an incredible pace. I've always thought it's possible to do it without making mistakes. Still do.  -- 2025-03-23T04:14:47.888Z

The new research on using F.F.T. based optimization could help in making L.L.M.s faster, cheaper and able to handle longer contexts.
