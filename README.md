> Many current programmers remember the Moore‚Äôs law curve. That was the period from the 70s through the 90s where clock rates and memory doubled every year or so. But that doubling stopped in 2005. Memory continued to get denser for a while, but even that has stopped. The current way that we increase computing power is by doubling the number of GPUs in server farms every year or so. But that can‚Äôt continue much longer. The power requirements, the space requirements, the capital requirements, and the sheer mass of it all, will exceed feasibility within a few more doublings.
> So don‚Äôt expect AIs to continue to improve exponentially.  They‚Äôre headed for a brick wall, and that brick wall is not that far away.

This is definitely something to think about by zooming out. However, one must be optimistic towards (and prepare for) new scaling laws towards A.S.I. and beyond.

### we're soo back!

> "Huge day for 0.0005% of followers" ~ Pewdiepie

pewd's here might've thought "it's a small thing, lemme just make a GitHub account and start pushing my files" but this could be a beginning of a beautiful (and sometimes unforgiving) rabbit-hole of things that bring joy to so many.


and yes, here's a link [Pewd's GitHub account](https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon) btw. Be kind :P -- [üèûÔ∏è Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/Gzz_4sCawAAlQ87.jpeg) -- 2025-09-02T13:31:12.628Z

Today, I learned that you can format SQL statements in Postico 2 without worrying too much. There is an in-built feature in the query editor that allows you to do so.

Just select the SQL query, you want to format and right-click and choose `Format SQL statement` option.

Alternatively, we could also choose the statement and hit control F.

although, I'd prefer to not use such keyboard shortcuts because it could get dramatically problematic by bringing muscle memory to all this.  -- 2025-09-02T10:03:01.222Z

The sooner you test ideas, the more time you waste holding on to it before you realise it wasn't the best of the ideas.

The best ideas come with a significant volume of lame or laughable ones.  -- 2025-09-02T06:30:07.998Z

Some interesting quotes:

> My mind fills up with a few key projects and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm absorbed by those. That‚Äôs where my attention is.

If your mind isn‚Äôt filled with 2-3 key projects where you can riff your attention towards new things every day, then you‚Äôre doing something wrong.

> Time and attention aren‚Äôt the same thing. They're barely related.

They maybe two different dimensions but they‚Äôre definitely intertwined like Space-Time & Electro-Magnetic waves etc.
