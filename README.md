I was today years old when I learned that Atom and R.S.S. feeds aren't really the same thing.

All the world's problems because you couldn't load production scale data in your local and test the true performance.  -- 2025-09-07T12:16:27.774Z

Think, Plan and then let A.I. execute.

Tell it how you think. Then it will teach you how to think better.


This helps tackle some [*"frustrations"* I've encountered](https://x.com/TnvMadhav/status/1948732227786821928) in the past.

Try to optimize for lowering context switching per scroll action.

I've been a fan of Founder's podcast ever since my first listen.

I think it's all in the delivery, where repetitions and redundancy helps a lot in keeping things in context.

The latest episode on Elon Musk was really inspiring. It must've been hard to make but the end result are worth listening to many many times.

Kudos to David Senra üëèüèª for keeping the quality top-tier.

I have always used the voice dictation feature on the iPhone cuz I dislike typing on the phone, but I've never thought of enabling it on my MacBook. 

Well one can easily guess how it feels now that I've enabled that feature.

What blew my mind is that it works even with neovim text editor (decently enough).

This is best for journaling and maintaining work logs. -- [üèûÔ∏è Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/image_fw9y6z7.png) -- 2025-09-05T10:01:57.485Z

> Many current programmers remember the Moore‚Äôs law curve. That was the period from the 70s through the 90s where clock rates and memory doubled every year or so. But that doubling stopped in 2005. Memory continued to get denser for a while, but even that has stopped. The current way that we increase computing power is by doubling the number of GPUs in server farms every year or so. But that can‚Äôt continue much longer. The power requirements, the space requirements, the capital requirements, and the sheer mass of it all, will exceed feasibility within a few more doublings.
> So don‚Äôt expect AIs to continue to improve exponentially.  They‚Äôre headed for a brick wall, and that brick wall is not that far away.

This is definitely something to think about by zooming out. However, one must be optimistic towards (and prepare for) new scaling laws towards A.S.I. and beyond.

pewd's here might've thought "it's a small thing, lemme just make a GitHub account and start pushing my files" but this could be a beginning of a beautiful (and sometimes unforgiving) rabbit-hole of things that bring joy to so many.


and yes, here's a link [Pewd's GitHub account](https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon) btw. Be kind :P -- [üèûÔ∏è Context #1](https://cpx.tnvmadhav.me/content/image/content-images/Gzz_4sCawAAlQ87.jpeg) -- 2025-09-02T13:31:12.628Z

Today, I learned that you can format SQL statements in Postico 2 without worrying too much. There is an in-built feature in the query editor that allows you to do so.

Just select the SQL query, you want to format and right-click and choose `Format SQL statement` option.

Alternatively, we could also choose the statement and hit control F.

although, I'd prefer to not use such keyboard shortcuts because it could get dramatically problematic by bringing muscle memory to all this.  -- 2025-09-02T10:03:01.222Z
