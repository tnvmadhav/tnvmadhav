## How do you organize work as a solo developer?

I've tried Notion Databases. It's great to see history of projects. Notion feels clunky nowadays but ok.

For simple, lightweight, fast organisation, I'd recommend maintaining a single file as a todo list.

A file per project. This can be markdown (todo.md) with checkboxes or just a simple todo.txt

This helps you add/edit stuff to the list rather quickly.

This is no answer. Just do things.

TIL that there's a whole package (I mean it was obvious in-retrospect) called `Charts` in SwiftUI. [^1] 

I was experimenting with bar graphs and charts (for an iOS app - hobby project) and was planning on raw dogging rectangles (ik LMFAO).

But now the Charts package can help cut down on time. I'm yet to dive deep but it looks super easy (thanks to SwiftUI's simplicity) but I'm sure I can get results faster.

After playing with Bar Graphs and referring to example implementations [^2], I noticed that one could create the same types of charts baked in iOS apps like screentime, health, etc support.

This is great news (in general but) especially for backend developers like myself who are dabbling with design and client-side application development for (limited scope) hobby projects.

If this happens to anyone on @X, you should immediately log in to x.com and go to [Sessions page](https://x.com/settings/apps_and_sessions) and check if this is true. 

If you're still unsure, click `log out all other sessions` button only via the official x.com app/website's sessions page.

Keep safe!

Just migrated to GPT 4 [structured outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) (out of sheer frustration) in my hobby project. It's so much better now. 

More deterministic I should say in terms of NOT getting an `unexpected end of JSON input` error message intermittently.

Thank you @openai for this productivity boost :) -- 2024-08-23T04:20:23.517Z

I don't understand why people hold absolutist ideals (for others) on building stuff.

Like do what you want and eventually stick to something that works for you and your team.

This is an [interesting infographic](https://a16z.com/100-gen-ai-apps/) from a16z depicting the top 50 Gen A.I. products by unique monthly visitors.

I'd like to think I do keep myself up to date on the latest GenAI products and releases on X.

But, (to my surprise) I found that `character.ai` is placed at Number 2 ðŸ˜³ above Perplexity and Claude.

Strangely not many (in my X feed) talk about it that much. I didn't even know what they did exactly.

It's about chatting with AI avatars of characters mainly from pop culture.

I see >100 million conversations with fictional anime characters like Tatsuki Bakugo (from BHA anime/story) and characters from the popular game called Genshin Impact.

And it makes so much sense (to me). This is something people don't usually talk about because it could be private.

Once again I'm reminded that I'm only in the tech development bubble and do not have a grasp of the full scale of the proliferation of A.I. in all segments of the internet.

And this is just one segment. I have only used 3-4 of these. Worth a deeper dive on. -- 2024-08-22T14:30:28.199Z
